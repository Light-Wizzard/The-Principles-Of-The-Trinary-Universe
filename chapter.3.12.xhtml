<h3 id="chapter_03_12" class="a_header"> Chapter 3.12:<br />Trinary Engine Math </h3>

<p class="text_top">
    This is an introduction to Trinary Math that applies to the Trinary Engine,
    Trinary Engine Math is very simple,
    the Engine itself only has 3 State Changes:
    0, (<sup>+</sup>1) and (<sup>-</sup>1),
    and is represented as the Constant formula
    <span class="text_code">(<sup>+</sup>1) + (<sup>-</sup>1) = 0</span>,
    which states that the function of Quiescences denoted as a Q,
    and the function of Containment represented as a C,
    are all the math I need as proof of this simple relationship,
    the rest of the Math has already been done by Kepler and Newton.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    When a Trinary Engine is born,
    its outside shell is in State 0,
    and all the state changes inside of it are only toggling between
    (<sup>+</sup>1) and (<sup>-</sup>1),
    or Light and Dark Energy,
    this is called Containment,
    and everything in it is in balance and is known as the state of Quiescences,
    so for the engine to grow,
    we must do some math,
    so we can write this math in various ways,
    but I like to look at it from the state of Logic,
    so I will write a small C like program function to show how simple this is:
</p>

<div class="text_code">
    <span class="toc_level_1">if ( state == { 1, (<sup>-</sup>1) } )</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_2"># Change State requires the outside to gain a 0,</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_2"># and inside to gain the set of 1 and (<sup>-</sup>1)</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_2">if ( Q( { 1, (<sup>-</sup>1) } ) &lt; C(0) ) </span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_3"># If adding another set of state changes inside Containment</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_3"># after we add a State change of 0 to it, </span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_3"># is less than what it can handle then make change</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_3">state = 0; # Change State to 0</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_2">endif</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_1">elseif (state == 0)</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_2">state = state;    # No change required</span> <br />
    <span class="toc_level_1">endif</span> <br />
</div>

<p class="text_indent">
    Basically it shows that if a state change of (<sup>+</sup>1) and (<sup>-</sup>1) is encountered,
    it can convert it to the 0 State if the criteria is met,
    and then add it to the outside of the Engine
    and then add the state changes of (<sup>+</sup>1) and (<sup>-</sup>1) to the inside,
    so the inside stays in Quiescences,
    and the outside can Contain it,
    so the function of Containment is to make sure it can Contain all the Energy inside it.
    Basically this means that it needs Light on the Inside,
    and Neutrinos on the Outside,
    and it grows so that it can maintain the Mass of the Surface around it.
    When the Light without Darkness calls the Neutrinos using a specific Frequency and Wavelength,
    it creates Particles from the Neutrinos,
    that form to create one Particle called an Atom,
    as such,
    this Trinary Science is about the Math behind the State Changes,
    and the Pattern in which it grows,
    and it does this by moving from one Track in our Galaxies Disk,
    as if this Galactic Disk is a Record Player,
    and the Arm that plays it,
    makes sure that all the Suns travel around the Galaxy at the same Rate by at a Different Speed,
    I will go into more details in:
    <a class="a_link" href="chapter.4.12.xhtml#chapter_04_12"> Trinary Mathematics</a>.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Math of Kepler and Newton fully explain all the Orbits of Planets inside our Solar System,
    but do not explain the Orbit of our Sun around the Galaxy,
    and that Math is <span class="text_code">(<sup>+</sup>1) + (<sup>-</sup>1) = 0</span>,
    where the 0 is a Dimension where the Ground Plane of the Galaxy and Solar Systems is,
    and (<sup>+</sup>1) and (<sup>-</sup>1) correlate to the Sine Wave that the Suns path through the Plane seen in:
    <a class="a_link" href="#illustration_3_07"> Illustration 3.07: Sun Path makes Sine Wave</a>.

    In Science: Empirical Evidence is based on observable phenomena,
    and the fact is that this Sine Wave path the Sun makes is also more complex in Nature,
    because it also forms a Helix when viewed in 3D as seen in:
    <a class="a_link" href="#illustration_3_08"> Illustration 3.08: Sun Path makes Sine Wave and Helix</a>,

</div>

<p class="text_small">
    This pattern is seen in many types of phenomena,
    Electricity is one example where it is clear that all Energy behaves in this manner,
    so the Math is already known,
    even though the Frequency is just a guess based on a Galactic Year,
    which is about 226 Million Years,
    based on Mainstream Science,
    this illustration also shows a Dark Star and one Companion Dark Star,
    although there can be many Companion Stars,
    I see no need to guess at how many of them there are,
    and it is easier to explain one,
    and it does not change the Math of the Trinary Universe,
    the Dark Star is pulled around the Galactic Plane at the same rate,
    such that the outer Solar Systems will travel faster,
    and in line with the inner Systems,
    as such, the inner and outer system are in sync,
    such that the Math of
    <span class="text_code">(<sup>+</sup>1) + (<sup>-</sup>1) = 0</span>
    forms this Helix when it is combined with Newton&#39;s Math describing a Sine Wave,
    and the Sun travels faster as its heading into the Galactic Plane,
    so its speed has a range between a minimal and maximum,
    and I calculated that to be between 333,333 and 666,666 Miles per hour,
    this confirms Newton&#39;s calculations using other Math,
    which means its speed is not constant,
    because it is wavelength and frequency vary to maintain this speed around,
    putting it in the range of 3.333 to 6.666 hertz,
    it is about 7.826 hertz right now,
    and the Core of the Planets and Surface are not the same Frequency,
    so do the math and think what you want to think,
    believe what you want to believe, but do as Newton did and prove it to yourself.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    I try to teach in Steps,
    and this step is not ready for Trinary Math,
    we have to talk about many things before then,
    so the answers are coming,
    for now, you just need to see that this Math is very simple,
    it is based on what it needs to know to do its job,
    as such: everything the Sun needs to do,
    is based on its Size,
    and the Number 137 plays a huge role in calculating the Speed where Life can exist in the Galaxy,
    so knowledge is what we learn in steps,
    and in this step,
    all we needed to learn was about Trinary Engines,
    and how they can grow, shrink,
    and even disappear when no longer required,
    and how they use the same Laws of Physics as Atom&#39;s.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    Trinary Engine Math is any Math like Kepler&#39;s, Newton&#39;s, or Tesla&#39;s,
    that is based on God being the Force of Gravity in the Equation;
    so I did not need to list all the Math that Kepler, Newton, or Tesla wrote,
    since it was all based on God being the Force of Gravity,
    since it was based on what Newton said.

    Once you understand what that meant when the Bible stated that God was All Light without Darkness,
    and the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
    describe Electricity and Light,
    so it is really just the Math used by Trinary Engines.

    I will cover Trinary Math in more detail in the next chapter,
    where I will cover how to calculate the Speed, Distance, and Frequency of Trinary Engines,
    and cover the Trinary Engine Math in more detail.
