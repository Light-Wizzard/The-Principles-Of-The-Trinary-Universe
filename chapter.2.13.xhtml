<p class="text_indent">
    I would like to say that this is the most profound concept that I came up within this Document,
    but compared to the Trinary Engine it pales in comparison,
    but it does prove just how wrong Albert Einstein was about the Mathematical Relationship that Energy has with the Universe,
    as you will learn in this Chapter,
    in practice, you will find that generally people, including myself,
    draw on things they know or think are true,
    if that thing turns out to not be the truth,
    then everything I based it on was not the truth,
    so it unravels the nature of the truth that most hold so dear to them,
    so all your Truth is about to change for the first time,
    well, the first time since you started to read this book,
    that is if you are reading it right now, I never know,
    these are just Words on Written Pages,
    about a Subject about what Energy really is,
    and how you can measure it,
    but first, you have to understand that Fire is just Electricity,
    most people will have a very hard time understanding this simple concept,
    and put aside the fact that you can not start a fire without Electricity,
    rubbing two sticks together creates Friction,
    which excite the Atom&#39;s in the Sticks,
    causing them to raise in Frequency,
    and that means its Electricity,
    so put aside the logic and reason and Empirical Evidence,
    that is just the Truth of the matter or antimatter,
    and this concept will change your concept about Fire.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Trinary Energy controls atoms by changing their Frequency,
    which in turns changes their Acceleration,
    which is why if you use a Frequency Generator,
    you can push Electrons through a Material and cause that Material to catch on Fire,
    the Frequencies that every Atom catches of Fire should be documented,
    I will add a reference to this information once I compile it,
    right now its just a place holder for this information to be documented,
    I will call it &#8220;Trinary Energy Fire Resonant Frequency Table&#8221;,
    I call it Trinary Energy because it is the Intelligence that unbinds the Neutrinos when they catch fire,
    this table will list all the information you might want to know about every Element in the Periodic Table of Elements,
    like its Atomic Number, Name, Symbol,
    Fire Resonant Frequency, Boiling point, Melting Point, Freezing Point, Density,
    Ionization Energy, Electronegativity,
    Van der Waals Radius, and Covalenz Radius.
    This table can then be used to verify the Phenomena called Fire,
    so you can learn to fight Fires by lowering the Materials Atomic Frequency,
    kind of like a LASER Gun that burns things at this Fire Resonant Frequency or the Symbol F,
    so you can create a Freeze Gun,
    but it will not blow out cold air,
    it will instead emit Electromagnetic Energy that will alter Atomic Frequencies it encounters,
    so you should be able to put out fires with an Electromagnetic Energy tuned to do such a thing,
    but that is just a Theory at this point,
    because I do not have the equipment to prove this,
    but for those that do,
    fill out this chart first,
    then work on tuning Magnets,
    I would suggest using coils that are wrapped around a tuning fork as such,
    the Coils need to be variable in size,
    so the tuning fork will move, and the coil will coil around it,
    and the power needs to be very flexible,
    so you need a frequency generator capable of very low frequencies at very high power levels,
    and we are dealing with low frequencies and high power.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Fire is a specific type of Electromagnetic Energy,
    it is invisible to the naked eye, yet its effects can be seen,
    a spark is such an effect,
    but its also just a reaction to the Gas around it,
    a spark in a vacuum can be used to verify this,
    but it does not take a Spark that we can see to start a fire,
    it can be caused by too much energy flowing through a conductor,
    so it is this unseen energy that causes fires also.
    This Fire Energy is at a specific frequency,
    and every Element in the Periodic Table of Elements is a type of Neutrino,
    that has a known range and a specific frequency that it resonates at,
    and at a specific frequency the oscillations will cause the Atomic Particles to disintegrate,
    meaning that the Neutrinos will break their bonds and release the Light inside of them,
    not as explosive as an Atomic Explosion,
    because that is caused by particles accelerated close to the Speed of Light,
    which causes their Matter and Antimatter Neutrinos to come into contact with each other,
    so it is really a Matter/Antimatter bomb,
    and that is the Term I would like it to be changed to,
    because the terms Atomic or Nuclear have a lot of bad science behind them.
    Fire only causes the Shell of Neutrino Partials to go into the 0 Dimension and then not come back,
    neutrinos detectors can verify this,
    thus releasing the energy that was stored inside the Atom,
    this can be measured as heat,
    and converted to Electricity,
    since that is what it is,
    so if we can start a fire with Electricity,
    we can put it out,
    but we need to remover the Energy from it,
    much like an Electric Generator Collects Electrons out of the Air and even Vacuum of Space,
    it does not create Electrons,
    so this Tuning Coil we need to make,
    must pull the energy out of the Fire,
    it can do this in 3 steps,
    the first is by absorbing all Electromagnetic Energy,
    Silver, Gold and Copper work great,
    make a Faraday cage to put around the object,
    the second is by collecting all the Electrons you can,
    this can be done with an Electric Generator,
    and the third step is disrupting the Frequency of the Fire,
    this is why we needed a very flexible power supply and tuning fork coil,
    so we can create waves of Electromagnetic Force Field or lines of Electromagnetic Flux,
    this should be used to cause the frequency to lower in the object that is burning,
    if we take wood,
    we know what Atom&#39;s wood is made of,
    so we need to find an Electromagnetic Wave that causes it to lower,
    we can make all buildings out of this shielding by using it as the construction material,
    and each building can have its own Generator,
    it does not need to power the whole building,
    just large enough to dampen the amount of Free Electrons in the area,
    and it is power should be used to power emergency equipment only,
    so it is off the grid,
    then all you need to do is put these tuning fork coils somewhere in the roof,
    so they can be overall points of fire,
    now anyone in the building is safe from the fire extinguishers,
    so this technology can exist, and one day will,
    but first, we must acknowledge that Fire is just an Electromagnetic Energy,
    and current Mainstream Science does not view it that way.

<p class="text_indent">
    Resonance Frequency refers to an object vibrating at that given Frequency,
    for example, if you tape a speaker under a table,
    then whatever you put on top to the table,
    will resonate at what every frequency the speaker is driven at,
    meaning the frequency and the volume it is set at,
    so you can do a controlled experiment using this technique,
    but it can not generate enough energy to start a fire using commercial grade equipment,
    so do not try this at home,
    you need a lab to do these types of experiments,
    but every Atom in the Known Universe,
    and that means the big K in Known,
    because there are still Atom&#39;s we do not know about,
    but for the most part, we work at the molecular structure of science most of the time,
    and not at the Atomic Level of it,
    at the Atomic Level, you need a way to Resonate a single Atom,
    from the lowest, it can go in Frequency,
    which is 0, Negative Frequencies happen over a longer period of time,
    so you can only use Negative Frequencies in relation to time,
    for example, a 0 Frequency means we have less than 1 Frequency during the unit of the measurement specification,
    meaning: Second, Microsecond, or Trinary Second,
    as such,
    more accurate ways of measuring Frequencies that actually have less than 1 unit of movement,
    since in temperature, we deal with negative degrees,
    this Frequency is the unit of measurement for that degree,
    if its Frequency is at 0, it is not going to get any colder,
    if it does, it is a Negative Frequency,
    yet, in reality, it is just less than 1 for that unit of measurement,
    you increase it to hours, days, months, years, and then Light Years,
    now you see where Negative Frequencies come from,
    overtime, how long can we keep an Atom at less than 1 beats per cycle of time,
    but the concept that it actually beats less than that is what makes it a Negative Frequency at the same time,
    meaning that at 1 Trinary Second an Electron can travel from one Hydrogen Atom to the next,
    but at a larger unit of measurement like 1 Second,
    trillions of Electrons can orbit an Atom&#39;s in that time,
    so we are not only measuring the Frequency of the Atom,
    but the Electron around the Atom,
    and when it starts to orbit backward,
    it is in a Negative Frequency,
    so all Positive Frequencies have the Electron flowing around the Atom in the same Direction,
    but when the Atom&#39;s stops moving or is less than 1 frequency given a time period,
    that Atom has to have its Electrons reverse directions to be at a Negative Frequency,
    but this is possible,
    and it is also possible to run it backward at a more negative Frequency,
    driving its temperature up,
    so Negative and Positive Frequencies exist,
    but can only be measured by the Electrons Direction of travel around the Proton and Neutron,
    so negative frequencies are very important in science.
    On the top end of the scale is when the Frequency exceeds its limit to stay intact,
    and disintegrates, or is destroyed,
    this happens when its bonds between the Neutrino and Light break,
    the energy is released with the Neutrinos,
    and this can be measured with Neutrino Detectors,
    visually the Fire will be the biggest clue,
    but in an Atmosphere, the Gas has a lot to do with this effect,
    in a vacuum, it acts more like Electricity,
    so this disintegration or Fire needs to be used to find this Frequency,
    at the point in time when the Atom gives up its Neutrinos,
    and I call this the &#8220;Trinary Energy Fire Resonant Frequency&#8221;.
    Do not let the name confuse you,
    it is Trinary Energy,
    so its unbound Energy,
    meaning no Neutrinos,
    so the Atom has Neutrinos and this Fire Resonant Frequency is the measurement,
    for when this Atom gives up those Neutrinos and becomes Trinary Energy,
    as such,
    Fire Resonant Frequency refers to the Frequency of the Atom,
    and keep in mind there are Degrees of Fire,
    and I am not talking about Temperature,
    but the fact that an Atom has 3 types,
    so each is a Degree, the Proton is the 1<sup>st</sup> Degree,
    the Neutron 2<sup>nd</sup> Degree,
    and the Electron is the 3<sup>rd</sup> Degree,
    so logic dictates that its one Frequency for the Proton,
    another for its Neutron, and yet another for its Electrons,
    so it is not just one Frequency but all 3,
    but then the Limitation of our Technology kicks in,
    and we can not distinguish one from the other,
    so I can not explain to you how to measure the frequency of each independent of the other,
    so good old trial and error experiments apply here,
    you have to find each by hand,
    once you find one for each Proton, Neutron, and Electron for one just 1 Atom,
    you can refine your calculation and apply it to another Atom,
    but still, you have to check each one independent of the other.

<p class="text_indent">
    Normally Electromagnetic Energy is measured in terms of Frequency and Wavelength,
    Frequency times Wavelength equals the Speed of Light,
    but when talking in terms of a Resonant Frequency,
    we need a unit of measurement that is just one variable per element,
    this is a Constant for that element,
    so it does not make much sense to use its Frequency and Wavelength,
    since we are also talking about Atomic Structure and not just Electrons,
    but I do not have the equipment to find these numbers,
    but I know they exist,
    so instead of guessing at numbers,
    and also want some type of scale that had meaning,
    the Speed of Light is 670,616,629 Miles an Hour,
    I figure if I use that number as a maximum,
    then the Resonant Frequency would be measured in Miles an Hour,
    this relates Atom&#39;s to the Speed of Light in terms of Distance over Time,
    so it a really handy unit of time if you are using an Atomic Accelerator to find these Frequencies,
    but it is not a rate of Speed,
    but the Speed at which it will catch of Fire,
    it is like thinking about an Earthquake in terms of its Energy,
    a 10 might describe a very large Earthquake,
    but in terms of Electromagnetic Energy, I view this in terms of its Resonance Frequency,
    and that means the rate at which it vibrates to the point that it catches fire,
    in terms of vibrations,
    this can be measured in Frequency and Wavelength,
    which is fine for Electromagnetic Energy,
    but would make little sense to used to measure an Earthquake,
    or an Atom,
    so it forces you to view Energy differently as well,
    since an Electron is also an Atom,
    yet it has this same problem,
    once it hit is the Speed of Light,
    it is Light,
    and it is on Fire,
    that is what Fire is, Light,
    just a different type of Light than that of a Flashlight,
    but it is what White Light is,
    because the Sun Disintegrates Atom&#39;s by Burning everything it comes into contact with,
    so this unit of measurements is very useful,
    if I put a pole in the ground and measure it as not vibrating,
    I can say its x value is 0,
    if that pole is made of Steal,
    and if I put Steal in an Atomic Accelerator and it caught fire at 1 million miles an hour,
    since I have no idea what this number is,
    it is a guess,
    and Like I said I did not want to guess at these numbers,
    as such,
    if the pole vibrates at a thousand miles an hour,
    we know its vibrating at about the same speed in which the Earth Rotates,
    this is far from the Frequency it will catch fire,
    but its also a much larger Earthquake then a 10,
    since most Earthquakes are measured speeds less than a mile an hour,
    as such a 25 mile an hour vibration would feel like the impact of a 25 mile an hour crash into a brick wall,
    so now we have some unit that equates to Energy,
    and it is easy to see that at the Speed of Light,
    everything will be on fire, so it is an easy number to understand.
    Just to be clear about Fire,
    when x is at 0,
    where x is the Resonant Frequency of an Object at a given time,
    its temperature is going to be freezing,
    as its Frequency and Wavelength change as the object is sped up to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> the speed of Light,
    670,616 miles an hour,
    which faster than the Sun can travel through the Universe,
    so put these speeds into perspective,
    the only time will want to know the Energy level of something that is close the speed of Light,
    is when we are dealing with Atomic Explosions,
    even Chemical Explosions are causing Neutrino detectors to go off,
    so they too are Atomic Explosions,
    so short of an Atomic Accelerator or Explosion,
    in nature we will never deal with an x value even close to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> the speed of Light,
    so when dealing with a speed close to the speed of Light,
    just keep in mind that they will catch fire before turning to Light.
    We already travel through the Universe at the Speed of Light,
    so if you could travel at the Speed of Light,
    all you will really be doing is catching up to the Light that is Static in the Universe,
    so you know that all you will do is become that Light.

<p class="text_indent">
    You see this Fire as sparks given off of metal or steel when struck together at a high enough speed and force,
    as in Force = Mass of the object times its Acceleration,
    written: <span class="text_code">F = MA</span>.
    If the Force is strong enough the Energy transforms molecular structure that it comes in contact with,
    kinetic Energy will transform it into another type of energy,
    which results in thermal energy,
    which into turn alters the molecular structure that is forced to be compressed in this collision,
    and thus creating Gas,
    which can ignite making the spark have a color,
    note it is normally the Gas that creates these Colors,
    the Spark is just Electricity,
    and this can be confirmed in a vacuum,
    as can the fact that different Elements create different Colors,
    meaning they have different Fire Resonant Frequencies,
    so testing in a vacuum is a given,
    not that you can smell ozone in a vacuum,
    but you can then distinguish the effects Gas has on it and the force required to make a Spark,
    but this is old technology and tested over the years,
    it is the force that Gas Engines uses,
    it has a Gas and a Spark,
    it causes the Gas to catch Fire,
    giving off its energy,
    driving the piston down,
    much like the force of the hammer,
    it can produce work,
    but flint was very popular in the old days,
    but an electronic spark will work just as good,
    since its cutting out the middle man,
    because when two objects collide at high speeds,
    they give off Energy,
    where Energy is equal to the resonance frequency (when that type of Element catches on Fire or turns to Light,
    use a lookup table to get this information),
    or E = <span class="italic">F &#8722; (F &#8722; X)</span>,
    where X is Frequency, Wavelength or Percentage,
    the unit of Energy is based on the Atom itself when it gives up its Neutrino shell,
    which means it goes into the 0 dimensions and never comes out,
    you may see this, you may not,
    but it depends on the type of Element we are talking about,
    most of us call it: Fire, Burning, Melting,
    and everything has a burning point called Fire for the lack of a better name,
    and why rename something that has a name that works fine,
    so get your Neutrino detectors out just to prove this,
    Fire is based on Trinary Science,
    and not some generic formula you apply to all Atoms regardless of type,
    but why go by weight,
    that has more to do with how many Neutrinos it takes to make an Atom of that type,
    for example Lead,
    it takes a lot of Neutrinos to make the lead,
    that is why it is so heavy, and so is Uranium,
    so the question is what type of Element makes the best Atomic Reaction,
    and it is the heavy ones,
    because they are the hardest ones to break,
    which is why lead hammers make good Hammers,
    because they do not give off sparks,
    because they are so hard to break because the Shell is very thick,
    so they form weak bonds with each other,
    which makes the materiel malleable, or soft,
    and why it is not the best for a Bomb,
    but do not make Uranium Hammers...
    This does not apply to Atomic Collisions,
    because you will get lead to making a spark in an Atomic Bomb or Atomic Accelerator,
    but you will never get any Element to accelerate to even near the Speed of Light,
    and I only know of one that can,
    I call it Tritanium,
    and it is what Trinary Engines are made of,
    but Atomic Accelerators are well-documented Experiments,
    but the Speed of the Atom is still unknown,
    in fact, they have no idea where it is at any given moment in time,
    I know they say they can accelerate them near that speed,
    but they have no way to accurately measure it,
    but are we talking about Millions of Miles per Second,
    possibly even Billions of Miles per Second,
    but not the Speed of Light but a long shot,
    because every Element in the periodic table of elements has a unique Fire Resonant Frequency,
    although Einstein based it on the Speed of Light,
    which is obviously wrong,
    because not all Elements Fire Frequency is the Speed of Light,
    all of them are much lower,
    Atomic Accelerators proved that,
    they can only accelerate them so fast before they burn up,
    and I do not want to use the term disintegrate because that means for atoms to lose their bonds with its Neutrino,
    but at a larger scale, we see only Molecules,
    so its sometimes only the molecule that comes apart and not the Atom Neutrinos,
    but a Neutrino detector can confirm this,
    but it does not mean it burned up on Fire.
    Each unit of Energy is equal to one Atom,
    so the mass means how many Atoms are in it,
    so mass is not weighted as an object,
    which might contain many types of Atom&#39;s,
    nor is it a reference to its Atomic Weight Number,
    that is a reference to its Neutrino type,
    so this unit of measurement is unique to Trinary Science,
    so need to know how much the Neutrinos weight,
    and that means we need to know how much Gravitational Pull its Atom has,
    this can only be measured in outer space,
    meaning outside our Suns and Galaxies influence,
    because we need to know the weight of something so small that the Suns or Galaxies Gravity will influence that measurement,
    so this Mass is a measurement of an Element&#39;s Atom&#39;s: Proton,
    Neutron and Electrons Neutrino particle Count,
    in other words, if we destroy an Atom how many Neutrino Particles do we detect,
    we can do experiments to determine this,
    but it would be according to that device,
    and this unit of measurement will always be changing till technology gets it right,
    but it is the best we can do, and now we know what unit of Atomic Destruction we encounter,
    by using this unit of measurement,
    so it is not the same Mass Albert Einstein was talking about,
    so it is the amount of Atom&#39;s on a sliding chart of Elements in the Periodic Table of Elements,
    meaning that it is based on their Fire Frequency,
    and the higher the frequency the higher the Energy,
    also the faster it can be accelerated towards the speed of Light,
    so it is based on how much Energy in a ratio to the potential energy the Element has and how many of them there are in it,
    and that is not what Einstein said,
    so do not ever confuse E = MC<sup>2</sup> because that formula is not correct,
    I would have to fully explain this formula for you to understand it,
    but what you really need is to understand the unit of measurements,
    so Energy denoted as E is measured in Joules,
    a Joule of energy is equal to the force used to move a specific object 1 meter in the same direction as the force,
    and the Mass is measured in some quantity of its Physical weight like in kilograms,
    and C is the Constant for the Speed of Light and it is squared,
    so it assumes the Mass can be anything and only cares about how much it weights,
    so all Matter should have the same Energy,
    and we know this is not the truth,
    so this formula is incorrect in setting up the problem that explains the question,
    and that question is what is Energy equal in terms of the Mass of an Object,
    in other words, if I take 5 grams of this Element,
    how much energy can I get out of it,
    this is also assuming they come into contact with each other at very high speeds,
    since they need to accelerate to the Speed of Light,
    and it also assumes that you can accelerate anything up to the Speed of Light,
    not Near, but at it,
    then square that just so the number looks scarier,
    because that is why he did it,
    he even stated that in his notes,
    and he was not joking,
    the Mass times Acceleration is equal to Force not Energy,
    and that is Newton&#39;s Math for God that is All Light without Darkness,
    so Force can be transformed into Gravity,
    and E = F &#8722; (F &#8722; X) tells you actually how much Energy is consumed when you drop a known object from Space
    and watch it burns up on re-entry,
    as the Objects speed is equal to its Wavelength:
    Speed = <sup>Distance</sup>/<sub>Frequency</sub>
    as its speed increases its Frequency will increase and it is wavelength will get longer,
    for example if X = 50, and F = 100, E = 50%,
    if X = 100, and F = 100, E = 100%,
    that would not work with E = MC<sup>2</sup> so who are we fooling,
    because Force and Energy are related by a power curve: Force will increase as Energy Increases,
    it is a one for one relationship when it is based on individual Atom&#39;s of a specific Element with a known Fire Resonant Frequency.

    So just to be clear,
    Energy is more bang for the Buck,
    it all comes down to how much it cost you,
    the only way you can use the formula E = MC<sup>2</sup>,
    is if you can accelerate an object to the speed of Light then smash it into something that causes it to be destroyed,
    so this formula does not help you to calculate how much energy it takes to run a Light bulb at 60 watts,
    F = MA is the weight of the object times its acceleration,
    so if we convert mass to Neutrinos,
    we can count how many we use up with a Neutrino detector,
    so this moves Science ahead and not behind the Power Curve,
    so how can E = the Force squared is a question I always have to ask myself,
    because that is all this is doing,
    noting new,
    just take Newton&#39;s Math and Square to so it is just a bigger scarier number,
    and he made a few bucks for publishing it,
    so its more bang for the Buck,
    but it is not the truth,
    Energy is not E = MA<sup>2</sup>,
    yet the two letters are interchangeable since they both relate in terms of Speed,
    if A = the Speed of Light,
    the two formulas are the same,
    and that is true if E = MC<sup>2</sup> is true,
    so now the truth comes out, and is true?
    When you apply this to other problems in Energy consumption you will find it is not the truth,
    it is not with Atomic or Nuclear Energy,
    it is just a very large Scary Number,
    the truth is that there was no way to measure that much Energy,
    so a Guess is all they needed,
    the Formula had nothing to do with making the Bomb,
    its only function was to determine how much Energy it will put out give a weight of its fuel,
    and no one has ever proven this is even close to it,
    it is all just a Theory,
    and that means its never been proven to be the truth.

    How fire is started is always due to the Atom (single) vibrating at a given Fire Resonant Frequency,
    what causes it can be many things:
    friction, chemical, thermal, electrical, electromagnetic,
    and many other types of Energies that can transform into Fire,
    like striking a match,
    its caused by Friction reacting to a Chemical reaction,
    but in all cases, its Atomic Structure is being Modified,
    to what degree is a measurement of temperature,
    which is an Electronic Measurement of the Fire Resonant Frequency of an object before and after it catches on Fire,
    so it is the Energy which is equal to Fire Resonant Frequency times its mass,
    and it is as simple as that, easy to prove,
    has practical applications if you are interested in knowing how much energy something can produce,
    now you can calculate it down to the very Atom, and that is precision,
    so Trinary Science is based on real-world applications,
    unlike Einsteins Theory which was it did not matter what the Mass is,
    this is a known quantity for every Atom known,
    so it is based on the type of Atom instead of a Generic all Atom&#39;s are the same concept,
    and you can use it to measure the Energy in a Flashlight with having to accelerate it to the speed of Light,
    since its already traveling that fast,
    and now you are just talking about doubling that to get up to Relative speeds,
    that are based on things that are floating through space with us,
    so it is not even a very scientific speed, to begin with,
    but only Technology has a solution to that problem,
    but it all starts with how Fires start,
    because that is as fast as you can accelerate it.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Anytime thermal reaction is created you know that Atom&#39;s have burned up,
    in the case of Electronics,
    Electrons have burned up,
    and you used that energy after it burned up,
    which causes the material that is carrying the energy to heat up,
    this is the basic laws of Thermal Dynamics,
    work equals force,
    force is equal to the mass times its Acceleration,
    the faster the Acceleration the higher the Frequency,
    thus more force,
    so Acceleration is equal to Frequency, and it is Mass is its volume or Amperage,
    and in electronics that is how we control the Force,
    knowing this we can create heated blankets and electric stoves,
    we understand the effects of Fire,
    all we need to do now is understand that it is only Electricity,
    every Atom in the Periodic Table of Elements can conduct Electricity (some better than others),
    it all comes down to free electrons that are passing around all the atoms in a material,
    even Elements that are said not to conduct electricity and are called Insulators,
    but if you pass enough Energy through it,
    it will pass that Energy on,
    trust me on that test,
    insulators only work up to a certain threshold of Energy,
    so it is important to use the correct formula for Energy.

    The amount of energy used depends on the substrate the Electrons are flowing through,
    this can also create a Chemical Reaction,
    which is just Atom&#39;s reacting to each other,
    so what most people would view as a simple experiment like Lighting a Match,
    you can use an Electrical Spark,
    which is just Electricity at a given Frequency and Energy ample enough to cause the material in the match to burn,
    which means that all its Atoms that the Electrons come into contact with,
    will excite the Atom&#39;s to the same frequency causing it to catch fire if it is at its Fire Resonant Frequency or greater,
    how much greater will determine how long it will take to catch fire and how hot it will burn,
    again the formula <span class="text_code">E = F &#8722; (F &#8722; X)</span>
    explains that the lower the frequency the longer the wavelength,
    and the more energy it will produce meaning more Heat for the Fire,
    as the Atom&#39;s Transform into a Gas,
    the Gas will then Burn, so the more Gas the Material produces,
    the hotter the flame will be,
    so it comes down to Chemical Reactions,
    as well as Electron Frequencies that are flowing through the material and causing the fire to spread,
    so if you lower the frequency by shorting it out with Water,
    or cooling it down,
    which also lowers its frequency,
    you can also put out the Gas fire by starving it Oxygen or Catalyst that it has a Chemical Reaction to it,
    thus you can alter the Frequency by slowing down or stopping the Chemical Reaction Electronically.
    E = F &#8722; (F &#8722; X),
    where E is Energy,
    and <span class="italic">F</span> is the
    <span class="italic">F</span>ire Resonant Frequency of the Atom&#39;s in the Mass,
    which is the point where the Atom goes critical,
    meaning it burns or catches fire.
    What I know about this formula is that it came to me a while back,
    years ago, in fact, I had no way to confirm it,
    and I have another issue with it,
    this assumes all the Atom&#39;s in the Mass go Critical,
    and I know that this Resonant Frequency can be found,
    I just do not have access to the equipment I need to find them,
    so I am stuck.
    I also do not know if I need to take the Wavelength and multiply it by F,
    that thought will drive me crazy,
    because I know it will equal the Speed of Light,
    I might as well square it and be back to Einstein&#39;s original mistake,
    so what would be the point unless I normalized it first,
    by subtracting the actual frequency from F,
    which will give me an offset of frequency required for the Atom to go Critical,
    then multiply that by the wavelength of the actual frequency,
    I should get a number that equals the amount of energy being used at that point in time.

    This formula should work good for Atomic Bombs,
    because it is a given that all the Atom&#39;s will go Critical,
    but in Electronic Circuit is this is not the case,
    the ones that go critical will give off heat,
    those that do not will stay in the circuit,
    so this math formula is too simple to take that into account,
    it is a generic formula and should be much better than E = MC<sup>2</sup>,
    but it is in a unit of measurement few are familiar with,
    and that is 1 Atomic unit, how much Energy can 1 Atom create.

    As an afterthought, I wondered if I should call this Critical Resonant Frequency or CRF for short,
    my mind works with words and spells in a very unusual way,
    Fire goes back in history, but Critical is more Science like,
    we would not say we are going to start a Critical Mass,
    that sounds like an Atomic Explosion,
    we would say I am going to start a Fire,
    but in reality, I am talking about the Point that the Atom Resonates at, which will cause it to explode,
    or go Critical,
    so it is a more accurate term.

    In reality, you would want to put this formula into an iteration function,
    and feed in the Frequencies in real-time as they change,
    so you would end up with something like in:

    It may work out better to use the offset, where x is the frequency the Atom is at,

<p class="text_indent">
    The closer x is to <span class="italic">F</span> the closer to 0 you are,
    at 0 you just have <span class="italic">F</span>,
    if x is less than <span class="italic">F</span> then the Energy will also be less,
    that is a given,
    if the Atom is frozen, it will have a very small frequency,
    thus reducing the Energy,
    this is what we want, because we know that is the truth,
    the more excited the Atom is the more energy it puts out,
    this is not what E = MC<sup>2</sup> does,
    it just makes everything in the Universe look like Energy is a Bomb,
    that only needs very large scary numbers to explain it,
    but in reality, we need to determine how Atomic Energy relates to everyday use,
    like in determining how much energy is in a Battery,
    try plugin that into E = MC<sup>2</sup> and see how intelligent this Formula is.

    To make this simple:
    here is the Energy Calculator in
    <a href="http://LightWizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/webforms.xhtml#table_2_11" class="blank_target_link"> Table 2.11: Energy Calculator</a><br />
    http://LightWizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/webforms.xhtml#table_2_11<br />
    to test out the Formula;
    Where:

    I could never wrap my head around E = MC<sup>2</sup>,
    it does not take into account what type of Atom is in the mass,
    and assumes it will go critical at the speed of Light,
    which it will way before then, so how does this formula work?
    This will bug me for most of my life,
    and I thought about it till I came up with a solution that actually works,
    but the unit of Energy had to be in Atom&#39;s,
    so you might be tempted to convert this to some other unit of Energy,
    but in reality,
    this is the unit of Energy that everyone should be using,
    grant you the numbers will be very large,
    but if you could chart out all the known Energy levels of every Atom,
    you would have the information you need to improve this math,
    but the unit of that math will always be in Atom&#39;s or the Mass of them measured in Neutrino Count,
    this will make Neutrino detector accuracy to be a new standard in Trinary Science,
    and the type of Atom will determine how much energy is produced,
    but knowing the Frequencies that every Atom goes critical will give you a baseline for all Energy Levels,
    because the offset will take into account the Energy an Atom can produce,
    the closer <span class="italic">F</span> is to the Speed of Light,
    the more energy it can store up,
    so it is a numbers game,
    the higher <span class="italic">F</span> is the higher the Energy yield,
    so this knowledge is critical to the understanding of Energy.

    Without knowing how much energy is in 1 Atom,
    knowing that every Atom will have a different amount of energy in it,
    I am just guessing at the relationship,
    until I can actually collect the data that I need this is just a guess at best,
    but I do know that Energy has to do with how many Atoms you have,
    and what frequency they are at,
    and that is what this formula does is calculate it.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    I do not know if Math is your thing,
    but you know enough about it to do this math,
    it is very simple and you know Electricity as well as most people,
    you are using it more than likely,
    so think about this, if you take 1 Atom,
    which we do not currently have the technology to do this,
    but imagine if you could,
    an Atom includes Proton,
    Neutron and Electron, and it is mostly the Electrons that we deal with in Electricity,
    the Atoms are just the Conductor,
    so 1 Electron is a known quantity,
    we know how much energy 1 Electron has,
    but we can not isolate it,
    nor can we measure it with our current technology,
    at least none that I know about,
    but if it is out there,
    it is top-secret because no one is talking about,
    so we have to deal with the Technology of today that is not Secret,
    so we just do it in quantity and try to figure out how that relates to 1 Atom.
    We know that quantity is the key to power,
    the more Electrons,
    the more Energy,
    but think about it from the Electrons point of View,
    it is made of Neutrinos,
    the problem with this experiment is that it takes a lot of Neutrinos to set off a Neutrino Detector,
    but still,
    if Technology is available that can detect the Neutrinos that will be freed when the Atom reaches its Fire Resonant Frequency,
    we can prove this,
    but I know that experiment has been done many times,
    so I know its just a fact,
    but still, I am talking about 1 Atom, and modern technologies is not there yet,
    but my point is: that they do not need to be, we know when you destroy an Atom,
    Neutrinos are detected,
    that is a fact in science, so we know Atoms are created from Neutrinos,
    just because Mainstream Science does not acknowledge that,
    does not mean it is not proven, because it is,
    so wrap your mind around what I am saying,
    Fire is the Point were Atoms are being Destroyed,
    Neutrino detectors have verified this, the evidence is clear,
    the atomic structure of whatever it is that burned is gone,
    dust, ashes, gas leaves no trails, poof, its gone,
    do the experiments in a vacuum,
    and in a closed container that can measure all the Transformations of Fire,
    to see what Atoms do get destroyed,
    and in Electronic circuitry, they do all the time,
    which is why it is so hard to get Neutrino detectors to work above ground,
    because there is too many Atom&#39;s being destroyed,
    it overwhelms the detectors,
    yet we know enough to know this is the truth about Energy.
    If we take an Atom and look at it when its Frozen,
    its Frequency is very low,
    if we apply a Frequency to it, it will warm up,
    if we increase it to the point it melts,
    it will transform into another type of material,
    this is more at the Molecular level,
    since at the Atomic-level I am only talking about 1 Atom,
    and it does not Melt, nor does it Freeze,
    so keep that in mind,
    it is just at that Frequency it is at, at that point in time,
    the Atom is just there,
    well it is there <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> of the time,
    it is constantly shifting from Solid, Semisolid and Invisible,
    and if it turns invisible and does not come back, that Atom is Destroyed,
    and its Light will be given off as Energy,
    this is what Energy is and how it works.
    So if measure this Frequency of the Atom from the lowest to the highest we can vibrate it,
    because that is all the Frequency is,
    is a Vibration, and that Atom can only take so much,
    if you increase it high enough it will turn into a Photon,
    that is what Electrons do in a Flashlight,
    the Electron&#39;s frequency is raised to the Frequency of Light,
    if a Neutrino detector can detect the Neutrino from the Flashlight,
    you know that the Electron was destroyed,
    but normally I do not think that is what happens,
    because you can collect that Light and turn them back into Electrons,
    so they must still have their Neutrinos,
    so understand this concept, Atoms transform into Energy,
    do not confuse Atoms with Molecules.

    The maximum Energy level is equal to the frequency at which that Atom will go critical,    at which point the Atom is destroyed,
    minus the frequency that it is at, this is the offset,
    the closer it gets to 0,
    the more Energy the Atom will put out,
    so we minus that offset from the frequency it goes critical and times that by the mass of Atom&#39;s,
    and you have the total amount of Energy for each Atom in the Mass,
    and it is just that simple,
    so wrap your mind around Energy and you can calculate it with ease.
