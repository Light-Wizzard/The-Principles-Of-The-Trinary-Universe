<h3 id="chapter_03_10" class="a_header"> Chapter 3.10:<br />What is a Trinary Engine? </h3>

<p class="text_top">
    A Trinary Engine is an Atom on a larger scale,
    it is made out of the same material as some Atoms,
    which is a Neutrino I call Tritanium,
    and they basically follow the same laws that Atom&#39;s do,
    one Trinary Engine can not physically touch another one,
    and they are also going through state changes.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    I could have called a Trinary Engine a Large Atom,
    but that would be confusing to most people,
    because all Atoms are very small,
    how can one the size of the Galaxy exist, but the more you look at it,
    there is really no getting around this fact,
    as strange as it sounded to me the first time I realized this,
    and that was an Original idea,
    because no one has ever come up with this idea before me,
    I did a lot of research to make sure of this before I made this statement,
    so I know it is the truth,
    and that is all I have ever done is told the truth,
    maybe that is the Aspie in me,
    but I can not tolerate lies,
    nor could Tesla, Franklin or Newton,
    as well as the other Wizards.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Trinary Engine took me years to understand all its aspects that I would need to explain it,
    I was very young the first time I thought about it,
    and it was when I was reading a book about the Universe that I realized just how Stupid Theories are,
    at first, I was told that it was just a best Guess at explaining how the Universe works,
    but Newton did that,
    so why did a Theory called General Relativity change that,
    and it is because it is normal to be Stupid and go along with all the Madness that Newton could not calculate,
    but I did,
    but these aspects about the Universe always came down to Electricity,
    it is in everything in the Universe,
    so reading what other Wizards wrote,
    I realized Theories are just Evil,
    they can make Stupid People actually Believe that they are the Truth,
    and that is why no one would ever believe me about Trinary Engines.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Having told this story for over 50 years or Half a Century now,
    I know that it is normal for People to be Stupid,
    and Stupid People will Defend their Stupid Theories,
    so there is no Teaching a Stupid Mind new Concepts that go against the Theories they believe in,
    and you can forget about teaching Religious People,
    they are the Worst kind of Stupid People,
    they believe that God does not Physically Exist,
    and that Belief is called Insanity,
    so I have no idea of what Audience I should Write to,
    I cannot Write about Trinary Engines to Stupid or Religious People,
    so this Book is not for them,
    I call them Sheeple,
    because the Lord is their Shepard: so they are Sheep,
    and the Lord Christ is a Lie, so they are all Liars,
    and I do not ever want to talk to a Liar,
    they have no Honor,
    and Honor is everything to me,
    so after Half a Century,
    I decided to write this Document to a Sheep called Yew,
    now Yes is a type of Tree called Taxus,
    and only Stupid Sheep will eat Taxus,
    so they have Shit for Brains,
    because Ewe are what Ewe eat,
    and if you Eat Taxus,
    you have Shit for Brains,
    so my Audience is only Yew,
    and now I can call Yew Stupid,
    that is what Half a Century has taught me,
    that I can not call Normal People Stupid,
    even though it is a Fact,
    because Stupid People will Argue with me,
    and I do not want to argue with them,
    so I only Write the for Yew,
    so You will not get offended if I call Yew Stupid,
    for not understanding this.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Teaching the Science of Trinary Engines to Yew is an unrewarding Job,
    I have to do it for Free because Yew have no Money because of TaxUS,
    and what is the Point, in the End Yew are just Stupid,
    and that will never change,
    but People, on the other hand, can put their Freewill aside,
    and Learn the Truth about God and the Engine that God Built,
    and Religious People will lie about believing in God,
    when all they believed in was a Deity,
    and the two are not the Same,
    even though Jesus Bar Abbas and Jesus Christ were the same Man,
    this only confuses yew,
    so Yew lash out and tell me that IAM a Liar,
    when IAM God,
    but in Reality IAM just the Dog that is Guarding a flock of Sheep I call Yew,
    so the Backward Spell for Dog is God,
    so this Book is just Entertainment for the Dog.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    A Trinary Engine is the Core for all:
    Galaxies, Suns, Planets, and Moons,
    as well are other objects that Fly through Space such as:
    Comets, Asteroids, and Meteorites,
    and Theoretically Dark Stars and their Companions,
    and it is based on Empirical Evidence in the form of Atom&#39;s,
    that are created by Neutrinos and Light,
    and it is an Original Concept of mine:
    Jeffrey Scott Flesher when I was just a child,
    so it is a concept from the Flesh,
    and the Original Idea.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Mainstream Science wants everyone to believe in the Theory of Chaos,
    because their main theory is the Big Bang,
    this is when all Physics has no meaning what so ever,
    since it will defy all Physics as we know it,
    and the whole Universe jumps out of a Black Hole,
    also known as a B-Hole,
    since they do not believe in God,
    it must be Satan&#39;s B-Hole,
    and all the Galaxies are performed,
    I seriously do not think they gave this theory much thought,
    otherwise, it would not be so stupid,
    since there is no such thing as Black Holes,
    because if there was,
    we would be in one right now,
    so Logic has no place in Mainstream Science.

    Mainstream Science thinks that the Earth and other planets,
    were formed by debris collecting into a clump,
    then a rock, then an Astroid, then a Planet,
    only thing is we have an Astroid belt,
    and I would think we would have more Planets in there,
    but there may be one Micro-Planet in there,
    but it is clear that they are not making bigger Asteroids in that debris field,
    proving how stupid Mainstream Science is.

    Mainstream Science believes you can Fold Space,
    this is perhaps their most insane theory of all,
    but it makes good Science Fiction,
    and that is where it belongs,
    and yew can add the Theory of Light Travel with it,
    as well as General Relativity,
    and all Theories related to it,
    because it is clear the Mainstream is all about Legal Insanity,
    and just wants to see how much BS people will believe.

    Once you fully understand how insane Mainstream Science is,
    you will know they are doing it on purpose,
    it is not possible that anyone could be so stupid as to believe in a Theoretical Universe,
    that has never been proven in over a Century,
    but Mainstream Science really does exist,
    and Stupid Sheep actually believe in it.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    What is a Trinary Engine,
    is a question about who God is,
    and what God is,
    and that always comes down to the Light inside of every Atom,
    and all a Trinary Engine is,
    is a very large Atom,
    so it has a lot more of God in it,
    yet it is because this is God,
    than the Mainstream Schools, Colleges, and Universities,
    consider it Religion,
    because everything to do with God,
    has to do with Religion,
    but that is not Truth,
    in Fact,
    I proved that is a Lie,
    because Religion only Teaches Deity Worship,
    and a Deity does not Physically Exist,
    therefore Religion and the Bible are not the same thing,
    because God in the Bible is All Light without Darkness,
    and that does Physically Exist as Light,
    proving the two are not the same at all.

    A Trinary Engine maybe Theoretical from the Point that I have no evidence to support it,
    other than Trinary Math,
    and Trinary Logic,
    and the fact that everything exists according to Math and Logic,
    which is normally proof enough,
    that something is a fact,
    and not a Theory.

    If I allow a Theory to define a Fact,
    it becomes a Theory about a Fact,
    and not a fact,
    so you must agree on what is a Fact,
    and what is a Theory,
    otherwise,
    you only have Theories.

    Facts are things you can prove are true,
    so you can prove all the things I call Facts,
    and then figure out if there are really any Theories in it.

    The Universe works the way it will no matter how I explain it,
    and it would be a miracle if I got it right,
    but I am pretty sure the Big Bang never happened,
    anyone that believed in that Theory needs Electroshock Therapy,
    followed by Insulin, do not forget to put a horse bit in their mouth,
    and they should not be allowed to operate heavy equipment,
    I have to be honest,
    I am embarrassed to say I am a Human,
    if this is how Stupid they think,
    and why they are nothing but Sheep to me,
    it is easier to make them subhuman,
    for pushing retarded science on stupid sheep,
    but give me a break, this is the Genie in the Bottle Trick,
    worse than Genesis, giving God only 6 Days to create the Universe,
    no wonder Newton called that Bible the Book of Sin,
    now let us talk about Real Science that you can actually prove to yourself.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    I have no Cell Phone to God,
    even though all my Cells are made from Atoms,
    that have God inside them,
    this is Trinary Science,
    because God is All Light without Darkness,
    and the Darkness is the Rainbow of Colors we call Light,
    so Humans call the Darkness Light,
    not the Brightest bunch of Apples on the Planet,
    but true science starts with the basic principle of the Universe,
    and that is what the Atom describes,
    it is made of Neutrinos,
    and there are 3 types of Atoms: Proton, Neutron, and Electron,
    and both the Proton and Neutron have All Light without Darkness in them,
    only Electrons have Light and Darkness in them,
    and this is right out of the Bible-Science to Wizards,
    Trinity or Trinary, it describes Atoms,
    but Atoms are very small,
    and the Bible said what is done on Earth,
    is done in Heaven above,
    so the Bible told ewe that is a Trinary Engine,
    fine, I paraphrased, Trinity Engine,
    well, maybe I added the Engine part,
    but yew know what I mean,
    a Trinary Engine is just a very large, or Macro Atom,
    and the only difference is the size,
    so now I defined the Principles of the Trinary Universe,
    right out of the pages of the Bible,
    and I can still call it Science,
    in fact, it is the Science of God.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Principles of the Trinary Universe is about everything,
    and not just one thing,
    but many aspects that all define what it is,
    in terms of Light without Darkness,
    or Darkness without Light,
    as if that exists,
    it is still under the control of the Light,
    and the Light is not in the Visible Spectrum of Light,
    only the Darkness is,
    but the Higher Power of God that the Bible talks about,
    is Atomic Energy,
    that is when ewe break the bonds of Atoms,
    allowing them to cascade into heat Energy,
    as yew convert Atoms into Neutrinos,
    thus using up all their energy at once,
    destroying the Atoms in the process,
    this is the process of Matter, and Antimatter collisions,
    as the Particles of the Neutrinos disintegrate,
    they collide with each other,
    creating Heat,
    and the effect can go Nuclear,
    but there are better ways to create Energy,
    other than destroying Atoms,
    and creating Nuclear waste,
    and Lightning is just one example of an unused resource for Energy,
    that is Grounded every day as wasted Energy,
    as such, the Principles of the Trinary Universe is about Everything.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Our Sun has many stories told about it,
    if the truth is among them,
    only time will tell,
    all I can tell you about the Sun,
    is what I can prove to be the Truth about it,
    and that Truth,
    is that the Sun is an Electromagnetic Generator,
    that is rotating due to its Frequency,
    just as our Planet Earth is,
    proving that it is the Light Force Fields,
    that is causing Gravity,
    just as Sir Isaac Newton said,
    God is the Force of Gravity,
    in All his Equations,
    and I just proved why,
    and all I really did was classify everything as Trinary,
    and now call the Core of the Sun,
    a Trinary Engine.

    Yes, the Nature of the Trinary Engine is fully explained in every detail.<br />

    Is a Trinary Engine Predictable?
    Yes, the Trinary Math makes the Trinary Engine very Predictable.<br />

    Yes, the Trinary Engine is Testable, we live on one, and can test it.<br />

    Is a Trinary Engine Tentative?
    Yes, the Trinary Engine is very Tentative, more discoveries are made daily.<br />

    Is a Trinary Engine Science?
    Yes, it meets all the criteria.<br />
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    What is a Trinary Engine is a question I hope I have answered for you,
    some might disagree with methods,
    but this is how Yew are,
    instead of doing the research,
    and determining if, in fact, my methods are correct,
    and if Yew just assume they are,
    just because I said they are,
    then you are no more intelligent for reading it,
    since my whole reason for writing it,
    is for Yew to prove it to yourself.

    Yew have to ask questions,
    and find answers,
    and do not take anyone at their word,
    prove it,
    Yew can disagree with me,
    but in ignorance,
    if you have not done the homework required to disagree with me.

    Yew think Yew Know the truth about the Universe,
    normally because Yew do not know the difference between a Fact,
    and Fiction, otherwise known as a Theory.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    If Yew were required to prove everything you disagree with,
    you would not disagree with much,
    so how do you prove to yourself that a Trinary Engine is Real?
    Logic is a long process of making decisions based on evidence,
    regardless of what Yew want the outcome to be,
    you have to allow the Logic to dictate the outcome.
    If Yew believe in Mainstream Theories about the Earth having an Atomic Core,
    you would have to dig very deep holes and see if the Earth is more Radioactive,
    and Yew know for a fact, that the deeper Yew dig,the less Radiation Yew find,
    so this is a theory Yew can not prove.
    The Earth has a very hot core,and Yew have to account for that heat,
    and it also has to explain what makes the Planet rotate on its Axis,
    and the theories start to lose credibility fast.

    Yew might think that nothing will happen if the Earth shifts Magnetic Poles,
    based on theory,so what is a fact about this,is a question everyone should ask themselves.
    In this book,
    I have detailed many aspects of what I believe will happen in the year 2060 that Newton Calculated to be the End of Time,
    and if it comes to past, then it is a fact.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    I can only define things the way I can prove them to work,
    and all Electric Generators will collapse their Magnetic Force Field,
    in order to revere polarity,
    it can do this without reversing the direction of the rotation of the Generator,
    and that is also true for a Trinary Engine,
    so when this planet finally finishes shifting magnetic polarity,
    and this is a very long process, that started back before the year 1000,
    this is documented in ships logs, that took magnetic readings,
    and our Magnetosphere is dimensioning in field strength,
    and by the year 2103, it will be gone,
    that is the last year it can go without switching,
    I calculate this to happen in 2061 under the Gregorian Calendar,
    Newton calculated 2060 under the Julian Calendar.

    When a Trinary Engine reverses polarity,
    changes take time,
    for example,
    our Sun reverses polarity at the end of every decade,
    yet by the time, we can determine that it has changed,
    many days have gone by since that change took place,
    because we do not see them in real-time,
    if we did,
    we would know that it takes about a year for the surface of the Sun to change Polarity,
    after its Core changes,
    as such,
    the Sun&#39;s core reverses polarity every decade,
    but by the time our technology can detect the full shift,
    a year or more will pass,
    and the Earth will do the same thing,
    but when that day happens,
    we will lose our Magnetosphere,
    and a lot of our Atmosphere,
    and this is something that I did not expect to happen,
    but when I run the simulation,
    an Ice Age follows due to the loss of heat in the Atmosphere.

    Like Newton, I did the calculation,
    take <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> of the diameter of Earth,
    7926.2109 Miles in Diameter, and divide it by 3 Phase,
    such that, Earths Iteration is 19.2851846712879 centuries,
    and compare this to the Sun Iteration is ((<sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub>) * 864575.9) / 3 = 2103.5909975401943 years,
    so the numbers are very close to being the same,
    so you have to use a long-running calculation to figure out the exact date,
    but if you take year 1 as a starting point,
    this will happen in 2061,
    according to Sir Isaac Newtons calculations also.

    The question Yew need to ask yourself,
    is if Sir Isaac Newtons calculations are right,
    because then the Trinary Math is right also,
    and then the Trinary Engine is a fact.
