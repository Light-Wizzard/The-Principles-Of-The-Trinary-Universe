<h3 id="chapter_02_14" class="a_header">Chapter 2.14:<br />Chemical Reactions</h3>

<p class="text_top">
    Chemical Reactions are a specific type of Electromagnetic Energy,
    and follow the same rules as Fire,
    just like striking a match causes friction to create a Chemical Reaction,
    you can also use Chemicals that react to each other,
    that can cause Friction that results in Fire, or Explosion,
    and it is easy to calculate because every Element in the Periodic Table of Elements has a Resonance Frequency,
    so if you are combining two different types of Elements, for example:
    if you take the chemicals that make up a plastic explosive like C4,
    and use it to combine two hydrogen atoms at high speed,
    you will form a helium atom,
    which will have a specific Fire Frequency,
    and because hydrogen only has a proton and electron,
    they are very difficult to break the bonds between the two,
    since it has no neutron to put more distance between the Electron,
    and Proton,
    so when they collide at a high enough speed to create Fire,
    they explode,
    this is called an Atomic bomb,
    which can then be used to split either Plutonium,
    or highly enriched Uranium to produce a Nuclear bomb,
    so Chemicals cause Electrons to Vibrate at a specific Frequency,
    or decay over time,
    it is the exchange of Atom&#39;s as they give up there Mass to form Thermal Energy,
    and can also be used to create Kinetic Energy by using its Potential Energy,
    and create Photonic Energy,
    and transforming into other types of Energies.

    Explosives are normally measured in how fast they burn, for example:
    commercial explosive cord is rated by how fast the cord burns,
    so you can compute how much is required,
    the Laws of Physics that applies to this,
    is based on Frequency and Wavelength,
    so we can think of Wavelength as speed,
    because it is a ratio of how fast we can cause the frequency in an object to accelerate;
    and is expressed as F = MA,
    so the Force is equal to the Mass times its Acceleration,
    and can also be expressed in terms of its Frequency, and Wavelength.

    Any Chemical reaction can also be expressed in terms of Electricity, or Energy;
    proving that all Chemical Reactions are Electrical in Nature.

    Alchemy is what Wizards like Kepler, Newton, and Tesla are known for,
    Newton used Chemistry,
    whereas Tesla used Electricity,
    both in the Laboratory,
    both could produce Chemical Reactions,
    one from Chemistry that was created with Potions,
    that Witches write about,
    for example an Eye of Newt,
    means to use Newton&#39;s Measurement system to measure ingredients by Eye,
    potions like the Green Dragon would create a Copper Chemical Reaction,
    that Tesla reproduced with Copper and Electricity,
    in a process called Electrolysis,
    so he reverse-engineered one of Newton&#39;s experiments,
    proving everything is made of Light,
    since Atoms are made of Light, and Neutrinos,
    a concept that I came up with when I was very young,
    but Kepler, Newton, and Tesla understood this concept,
    I just found the proof to prove it,
    so what I would like to do is document all of these experiments,
    and add a few of my own,
    and look at real Wizard,
    and Witches Potions to see what other Chemical Reaction can be Documented.

    Trinary Science teaches every Atom has Light inside of it,
    and everything is made of Atoms,
    therefore everything is made of Light,
    and all Chemicals are made of Atoms,
    so all Chemical Reactions are due to Atoms,
    therefore all Chemical Reactions are due to the Light,
    this is called Trinary Logic.

    I grew up poor,
    and never had much money for Hobbies,
    so I never got to work in Chemistry,
    and had to work a job in Electronics,
    just to work with Electronics,
    and why this is a short chapter,
    because I would have loved to work in Chemistry,
    and have my own laboratory,
    and try all of Newton&#39;s experiments,
    so I could write about them here,
    instead, all I can do is explain to you,
    that all Chemical Reactions,
    are do to Atoms,
    and they are all made of Neutrinos,
    and Light,
    so it is the Light causing the Chemical Reaction.
