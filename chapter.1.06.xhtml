<h3 id="chapter_01_06" class="a_header"> Chapter 1.06:<br />White Noise Experiment </h3>

<p class="text_top">
    Sir Isaac Newton included Imaginary Light in his work, but did not really talk about it much,
    only to point out that you must ensure it is Real, which means that Imaginary Light should not be able to be Recorded,
    but he had no such tools in his time, so this is Science at its best, proof to end this discussion for the last time,
    so we can do a Scientific experiment based on anyone&#39;s and everyone&#39;s observation,
    so we need to set up this experiment so it can be validated and repeated.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Form 2 Groups: a controlled group and a none controlled group.
    In the Controlled Group ask them to describe the &#8220;White Noise&#8221; that all humans see in their vision,
    this phenomenon is a very well-known fact,
    that has been studied for over half a century,
    so its existence and state changes are not in question,
    what we need to know is does it have a Pattern, and if so what is it,
    they need to record their observation after looking at a blank white paper and a blank wall of any color,
    in fact, test all colors and color combinations to rule out any perception issues,
    and you must do these tests indoors under artificial light, and also in a completely dark room,
    66 minutes is the minimal time and 3 days should be the maximum time spent in total darkness,
    and outside in the Suns Light, and then observe the Sky during the Day and at Night,
    they should also record the same White Noise using different types of cameras and recorders,
    including full-spectrum light recorders, which means that this recorder will record the full spectra of Light,
    including Infrared and Ultra Violet,
    these frequencies cover a spectrum starting before 0 hertz and travel up the scale as high of a frequency that can be recorded at the time,
    and also covers the range of amplitude from positive through negative like a sign wave,
    so you have negative frequencies to record also, not just negative amplitudes,
    and obviously you want a recorder without &#8220;White Noise&#8221; cancellation turned on, so do not forget to turn it off,
    so they can compare all the sighting and note any difference in what they saw and what was recorded,
    so we can all agree on what &#8220;White Noise&#8221; looks like,
    and how many state changes it has, and all the details we can conclude from it.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The none controlled group will be asked if they see &#8220;White Noise&#8221; under these same circumstances,
    but unlike the controlled group where you asserted that everyone on this Planet sees this &#8220;White Noise&#8221;,
    so it is a fact, and all you want to know is does it have a Pattern and if so what is it,
    so you set them up to assume that everyone knows that this White Noise exists and it has a Pattern,
    so what they will do is try to figure out what this pattern is,
    so this controlled group is preconditioned to believe that the &#8220;White Noise&#8221; and this Pattern exists,
    whereas the None Controlled group knows what the intent of this controlled group experiment is,
    and only needs to verify that in fact, everyone in the World sees this White Noise,
    if it has a Pattern is irreverent at this point, but I will prove this Pattern is encoded,
    so it will be very important to determine if this is Real Light or Imaginary Light, or if the White Noise even exist,
    do not assume it does just because I have stated that it does
    and use others work on it as a reference to the fact it actually exists,
    because I am a <span class="text_light">Schizoaffective</span> Aspie,
    but that does not make me Crazy, but the drugs might have, but my point is that no Science should start with Assumptions,
    unless you want to Assume the person wanting this test validated was Crazy,
    so question everything, and Assume nothing, and validate and repeatable.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    I have done this experiment many times over the years with many people,
    enough to conclude that even Blind people see &#8220;White Noise&#8221;, so I know you do,
    and I do not think you will find anyone that does not,
    even though most people will say they do not see anything in pure Darkness,
    it takes 20 minutes just for the human eye to adjust to the darkness,
    and Newton and I stayed in total darkness for 3 days doing this experiment, some 333 years apart,    and I can tell you the Light only got brighter and easier to see because it is a fact of life,
    stay in the dark long enough and you will go blind and see this Light for the rest of your life,
    trust me it is better to take my word for this instead of trying it, and it has nothing to do with Electronic Recordings,
    because they are recording the same thing we are seeing,
    and this Experiment has been done so many times over the years by so many people,
    that I assert it is a fact that &#8220;White Noise&#8221; is Real Light,
    because that was the Conclusion that Sir Isaac Newton was trying to make, and hundreds of years later nothing has changed.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    Some Autistic people seem to have an advantage over Neurotypical people when it comes to Pattern Recognition,
    whereas Allistic is not Autistic,
    but are Neurodivergent,
    and not Neurotypical so this advantage works for them as well,
    I refer to this as
    <a id="return_term_pareidolia_syndrome_1" class="a_link" href="terms.xhtml#term_pareidolia_syndrome">Pareidolia Syndrome <sub>[1]</sub></a>,
    this is a known fact, so no experiments are required, as was the above,
    but I needed to make the point, so I did the Experiment, and ask you to do the same,
    because all of what I am saying must be proven using Science, so to that end,
    I must point out that it might be due to the fact that I am Autistic that I even noticed this Pattern,
    and that just like with patterns in the clouds, most people do not see them the same way,
    so I will not talk about the Patterns much, because they have no real meaning in Science,
    other than looking at the State Changes,
    but these will create Patterns, so the experiments are important to prove, but only because of Science.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    Face it, if you do not believe that &#8220;White Noise&#8221; really exist, all the experiments will not convince you otherwise,
    some do not see the Light, and I can not show you a picture of what it looks like, nor a diagram,
    because it is just Light that shimmer around all objects like an aura, and it has 3 state changes,
    and I can not describe it much better, but it is not a visual perception problem due to the resolution of our eyes,
    because blind people can see it also, which means it might not even be our eyes that are seeing the White Noise,
    it might be our 3<sup>rd</sup> eye, called &#8220;I&#8221;, because that is how I explain it, because it is the truth of the matter,
    our eyes can not see the White Noise at all, as proof of this, when I close my eyes, the pattern does not change,
    so everything you look at will appear to have this white noise around it, and it does,
    but is it the white noise we see with our eyes, or is it really just in our head?
    The answer is that it is just in our head,
    as proof of this, I will let you study the Human Brain,
    if you put a person in a Dark Room and then Radiate them with certain levels of Cosmic Radiation,
    they will see it in their Head, not eyes, Astronauts confirmed this,
    its why we cannot travel to the Moon with no Shielding for Micrometeorites and Cosmic Rays,
    and Cosmic Rays are White Noise at a different Level of Energy.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    This is the White Noise Experiment,
    and White Noise has 2 State changes we can see,
    Solid, and Semisolid,
    we cannot see the 3<sup>rd</sup> State which is Invisible,
    and why it looks like White Noise,
    but you will have to do this Experiment to find out,
    first, you have to number the States as the Father,
    with a value of +1,
    and the Son,
    with a value of -1,
    and the Holy Ghost,
    or Spirit of Mother Nature,
    also known as Earth,
    or simple Ground,
    as such, the Holy Ghost or Spirit of Mother Nature is White Noise.
    Trinity was taught by Satan,
    the Fallen Angel,
    who inserted Christ into the Bible,
    although the Church murdered Jesus,
    and since Christ was inserted into the Bible after the Third Century,
    the Bible that I use as a reference does not have Christ in it,
    but it did have Trinity in it,
    and Newton was very upset about the teaching of Christ,
    since the Leader of the Deity Spirit Angel Team,
    whose name is God,
    does not Physically Exist just like Christ in History,
    so I renamed Trinity too Trinary to remove Religion from Science,
    so try this Experiment,
    and see if it changes the Logic any,
    Trinary has 3 Logical States: (+1), (-1), and 0,
    Trinary Math that proves this Logic is: (+1) + (-1) = 0,
    now graph this out on Paper:

    Reality all comes down to how we define it,
    if we define God to be one of many Angels,
    then expect A-Team Jokes about a Deity that does not Physically Exist,
    and try to figure out who the Joke is on,
    since Physically does not alter the fact that God does not exist,
    so expect Satanic Jokes as well,
    but are Jokes Experiments in Humor,
    or Humiliation,
    is a question you must ask yourself about a God that does not Physically Exist,
    and ask if they are Joking,
    because in the Bible God is All Light without Darkness,
    and that means that God exists as Light,
    and Sir Isaac Newton said that God was the Force of Gravity in All his Equations,
    so Newton is saying that the Light is the Force of Gravity,
    so do that Experiment as a Reality Check,
    do the Logic,
    if God is Light,
    and Light is inside every Electron,
    and every Atom,
    then everything we see,
    and cannot see,
    is made of God,
    or is God,
    since every Atom in the Trinary Universe has the Light without Darkness inside of it,
    God is everything made of Atoms,
    so this is the White Noise trapped inside Neutrinos from Atoms Experiment.
    If you want to prove God is All Light without Darkness,
    look inside of every Atom in the Universe,
    and you will find that Light of God,
    proving God exists inside every Atom in the Universe,
    so God created the Universe with God,
    and with the Help of Particles that form Neutrinos to create Atoms,
    so this is the White Noise to Life Experiment.
</p>

<p class="text_small">
    The more White Noise Experiments I can come up with,
    the more confused Yew will become,
    Yew were taught that God does not Physically Exist,
    knowing that Teaching goes against the Bible,
    and only Satan would go against the Bible,
    but yet White Noise Experiment, after White Noise Experiment,
    Yew come up with the same results,
    White Noise is Intelligent,
    just do not make into it a Religion,
    keep it Science,
    I will never tale Yew that the Trinary God is a Spirit,
    that thinks as we do,
    I have no idea what God thinks,
    and maybe IAM God,
    I have no way of knowing,
    maybe everyone is God,
    and the bad ones are Satan,
    and the one that wants to confuse Yew is Santa,
    but you know that God is All Light without Darkness,
    so why would you go along with the God is a Deity BS?
    It all comes down to what Yew can Prove to yourself about White Noise Experiments,
    because from my point of view,
    White Noise surrounds me,
    as it does everything,
    I am swimming in it,
    I am breathing it in,
    I cannot get away from it,
    it is everywhere I go,
    this must be God,
    because the Proof is in the Eyes of the Beholder,
    so behold God in your own Eyes as White Noise,
    that is inside every atom in the Universe,
    proving God is everything you can and cannot see.
    Once you understand that Trinary Science,
    is 3 State Logic Science,
    and everything in it is based on 3 State Energy,
    and every Atom in the Trinary Universe,
    has 3 State Light inside of them,
    you start to understand the Trinary Prefix.
    Once you start using the Trinary Prefix to Science,
    it becomes science,
    instead of Religion,
    or Science Fiction,
    so I decided that was the way to go,
    because White Noise is hard to rhyme things with,
    and the sound of White Noise does not help to promote it as Science,
    I asked my wife to buy me a White Noise Generator for the house,
    instead, she bought me a Pink Noise Generator,
    thinking it would be prettier,
    after that, I decided Trinary was much better of a Word to Spell,
    so I could say to do Trinary Experiments instead.
    A Trinary Experiment is a Logic Experiment,
    and we can also do Trinary Math Experiments,
    and then we can do Trinary Science Experiments,
    so we have endless experiments we can do using White Noise,
    or Trinary Energy,
    as the test subject,
    but the question will never change,
    who is studying whom?
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Our brain is a filter for White Noise,
    it has this Grey Matter that only has one purpose,
    to focus this Light,
    so the White Noise turns to Light when it interacts with the Grey Matter,
    this transformation is easy enough to explain,
    the White Noise exists in Empty Space,
    which is Space with no Atomic Matter in it,
    and the Grey Matter in our Brain is 99.999% Empty Space,
    and that does not change,
    we really are Air Heads,
    so the White Noise is in our brain filling up this Empty Space, as it does,
    the Atom&#39;s in this Grey Matter get stimulated by the White Noise,
    and are converted into Light,
    which is how our bodies produce this 98.6 watts of Energy we call a &#8220;SOUL&#8221;,
    which is just an acronym I made up meaning the
    <span class="underline">S</span>park <span class="underline">O</span>f o<span class="underline">U</span>r <span class="underline">L</span>ife,
    or Energy our body requires to form brain waves,
    produce muscle contractions, make the heartbeat, and other functions,
    and the Grey Matter is not the only place in the body that transforms this Energy,
    but it is the only place we see it, we do not see it with our eyes,
    and that is so apparent when you do the Darkroom experiments, it is not an illusion,
    we can see the Light in our Brain,
    just do the experiment,
    when you can see the Pattern of White Noise,
    note that it does not change when you go into the Darkness,
    but beware, the Light can Blind you,
    so do not be Blinded by the Light.
