    I do not like using Wikipedia also known as &#8220;Wackypedia&#8221; as a reference,
    because in my opinion this site is geared only to serve those who are making money from it,
    and they have No Interest in the Truth,
    thus it is &#8220;Mainstream BS&#8221;,
    and prints lies about people who have no recourse to get the lies removed,
    making it a worthless disinformation website,
    nor will they allow anyone to add content about real science to it,
    I have tried and found out what that website is all about, and Truth is not it,
    but Money, and controlling what people know,
    and only giving you their version of the subject, as if it was a fact,
    so it has no Scientific value to me,
    and like most references I use,
    they have nothing to do with what I am referring you to,
    so this whole idea of references,
    patents, copyright, trademarks, and so on,
    are all a waste of time, and resources,
    because it is all tied to Money,
    and this document wants nothing to do with Money:
    so I despise having to write in a way that is Legal,
    instead of a way that is true, but I make exceptions for the ones that I do use,
    because I can not find a good source of knowledge from a reputable website,
    nor any websites that share my view on the subject,
    because in all my life I have not found any information other than that I cite,
    that even refers vaguely to what I am explaining, so to make writing easier from me,
    you must assume that all the words I used came from myself, or one of the sources I list here as References,
    which also include any books or notes I have accessed in my lifetime,
    but do not remember where I got this information from,
    since my memory is notably impaired due to my medical conditions,
    so some words may have been copied directly from a web-page on the Internet,
    I try to reference those here, but if I do not, you can assume it came from somewhere,
    and the last place I would look is in my own Mind.

<p class="small">
    Born: 15 February 1564 (Julian Calendar), Pisa, Italy <br />
    Died: 8 January 1642, Arcetri, Italy
</p>

<p class="small">
    Was known as Astronomer, Physicist, Engineer, Philosopher, and Mathematician.
    His discoveries with the telescope revolutionized astronomy,
    and paved the way for the acceptance of the Copernican Heliocentric System,
    but his advocacy of that system eventually resulted in an Inquisition process against him.

    Galileo conducted experiments with falling objects,
    and wrote a manuscript Du Motu (On Motion),
    in opposition to Aristotelian views about motion, and falling objects.

    Galileo developed an arrogance about his work,
    and his strident criticisms of Aristotle left him isolated among his colleagues.

    Galileo learned about a simple telescope built by Dutch eyeglass maker,
    and developed one of his own in July 1609,
    Using his telescope to explore the universe,
    Galileo observed the moon,
    and found Venus had phases like the moon,
    proving it rotated around the sun,
    denouncing the Aristotelian doctrine that the Earth was the center of the universe,
    he also discovered Jupiter had revolving moons that did not revolve around planet Earth,
    and in 1613, he published his observations of sunspots,
    adding more insult to the Aristotelian doctrine that the sun was perfect.

    A thermoscope that Galileo helped designed is similar to modern-day thermometers,
    inside the thermoscope, a liquid rises and falls in a glass tube as the temperature of the liquid rises or falls.

    In 1613, Galileo wrote a letter to a student to explain how Copernican theory did not contradict Biblical passages,
    stating that scripture was written from an earthly perspective and implied that science provided a different,
    more accurate perspective,
    the letter was made public,
    and the Church Inquisition pronounced Copernican theory heretical,
    in 1616, Galileo was ordered not to &#8220;hold, teach, or defend in any manner&#8221; the Copernican theory,
    and Galileo obeyed the order for seven years out of fear,
    of being burned at the Stake.

    In 1623, a friend of Galileo, Cardinal Maffeo Barberini,
    was elected as Pope Urban VIII,
    and He allowed Galileo to pursue his work on astronomy and even encouraged him to publish it,

    but the Church proceeded with an Inquisition that lasted from September 1632 to July 1633,
    in a final attempt to break him, Galileo was threatened with torture,
    and he finally admitted he had supported Copernican theory,
    but privately held that his statements were correct,
    and he was convicted of heresy and spent his remaining years under house arrest.

    In time, however, the Church could not deny the truth in science,
    and in 1758, it lifted the ban on most works supporting Copernican theory.

    In the 20th century, several popes acknowledged the great work of Galileo, and in 1992,
    Pope John Paul II expressed regret about how the Galileo affair was handled. <br />
    Galileo published a number of books including:
</p>

<ol>
    <li class="small">The Operations of the Geometrical and Military Compass (1604)</li>
    <li class="small">The Starry Messenger (1610)</li>
    <li class="small">Discourse on Bodies in Water (1612)</li>
    <li class="small">Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632)</li>
    <li class="small">Two New Sciences (1638)</li>

<p class="small">
    Born: 27 December 1571 (Julian Calendar), Weil der Stadt, Germany <br />
    Died: 15 November 1630, Regensburg
</p>

<p class="small">
    Known for his laws of planetary motion.<br />
    Kepler&#39;s three laws of planetary motion can be stated as follows:
</p>

<ol class="list_pyramid_small" style="margin: 0.2em 0.3em 0.2em 0.3em;">
    <li class="small">All planets move about the Sun in elliptical orbits, having the Sun as one of the foci.</li>
    <li class="small">A radius vector joining any planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal lengths of time.</li>
    <li class="small">The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets are directly proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.</li>
</ol>

<p class="small">
    In 1596, he wrote the first outspoken defense of the Copernican system, the Mysterium Cosmographicum.
    Kepler discovered that the orbit of Mars was an ellipse, and in 1609 he published Astronomia Nova.
    In 1619 he published Harmonices Mundi, in which he describes his third law.
    Kepler published the Epitome Astronomiae in 1621.

    According to NASA, Kepler was the first to correctly explain planetary motion,
    first to investigate the formation of pictures with a pinhole camera,
    first to explain the process of vision by refraction within the eye,
    first to formulate eyeglass designing for nearsightedness and farsightedness,
    first to explain the use of both eyes for depth perception,
    first to describe real, virtual, upright and inverted images and magnification,
    first to explain the principles of how a telescope works,
    first to discover and describe the properties of total internal reflection,
    first to explain that the tides are caused by the Moon,
    first to suggest that the Sun rotates about its axis,
    first, to derive the birth year of Jesus, that is now universally accepted,
    first to derive logarithms purely based on mathematics,
    and he coined the word &#8220;Satellite&#8221; in his pamphlet Narratio de Observatis a se quatuor Iovis sattelitibus erronibus,
    proving that Kepler was the first person to change Science.

    Kepler lived in troubled times,
    and was on the move a lot,
    do to Religious persecution,
    as such, most of his time was spent trying to make a living,
    and running from this Church or the other,
    so he never really had the time to finish his work.

    From what notes survived him,
    some are public domain,
    but it is clear from reading them,
    that Religion was holding back his work,
    and he cared more about his work,
    then he did Religion,
    and was always on the run as a result of that decision,
    having been threatened by the Church,
    he knew he had to be careful,
    or he could be burned at the stake.

    It is clear that Kepler was a Wizard,
    he started the Secret Order of the Ashkenazi Masons,
    using his post that Tycho Brahe once held,
    as Kepler inherits all of his work as well,
    but gave him full credit for it,
    even though the Data itself is not what Kepler is known for,
    it was his proof.

    The concepts that Kepler wrote about,
    went against the teaching of the Church,
    and his explanation of how a telescope works,
    lead Newton to create a Reflector Telescope,
    using a Mirror,
    and that design is still in use today.

    If you examine the Life of Kepler,
    or Galilei who lived during the same time,
    although the two knew of each other,
    and Kepler did try to correspond with him,
    the Church would not allow it,
    proving that throughout History,
    the Church Murdered anyone that did not believe the way they wanted them to believe,
    and forced their views of Science as the only Science that exists,
    and nothing has changed in all that time.

    History teaches us who is bad by the deeds they do,
    and the Church is a Bully,
    and if they had won,
    and Galilei and Kepler would have just been Silenced,
    Newton may have never made the connection on his own,
    and the same goes for me if Newton had not figured it out,
    so it is clear that the Church is Evil,
    since it teaches you that God is just the name of one of many Angels,
    it is clear the one Name Satan is running the Church,
    that Murdered Jesus Bar Abbas for defeating the Roman Empire.

<p class="small">
    Sir Isaac Newton was known for proving that God was All Light without Darkness,
    but his quest took him into Witchcraft and Alchemy,
    and in his quest to find out how the people who wrote the Bible knew that God was All Light without Darkness,
    he discovered that Christ was inserted into the Bible to hide the fact that Jesus Bar Abbas defeated the Roman Empire,
    his notes on this subject became public domain back in the late 1800&#39;s,
    and he was soon branded as the Antichrist by Christians,
    who would rather go along with the Lie about there being two Jesus&#39;s in the Bible,
    just so they could continue to use Money, and Murder people in the Name of Christ,
    as a result, the Christians pushed for Albert Einstein&#39;s Theory,
    that Proved that God did not Exist,
    making Christians Anti God believers,
    and proving why Santa and Satan have the same Characters in it,
    and why Christians are all Liars and Satanic,
    because only Satan Lies about God and Science,
    and for thousands of years, Christians have murdered in the name of Christ,
    making them the most insane people on the planet,
    who build weapons of Mass Destruction using God as Fuel for their Weapons,
    because only Evil People make Weapons to Kill,
    and Christians are the evilest people on the Planet,
    they allow the Blood of the Planet to be used as Oil and Fuel,
    which is killing the Planet, and all Life on it,
    all so they can use Money, and Lie about what God is,
    stating that God does not Physically Exist in the Universe,
    because Christians do not believe in God,
    they Worship Money,
    and Engrave In God we Trust on it,
    when their Science-based on Theories that are never Proven to be a Fact,
    states that God did not create the Universe,
    Chaos did, so my Cousin Newton called them Sheeple,
    because if the Lord is their Shepard in Psalms 23,
    that makes them Sheep,
    and Newton would have no problem putting the Sheep in their Place,
    because they denounced his Science,
    and those Liars that follow the Godless Dynamic Universe,
    still, use his Math that is based on the Light of God being the Force of Gravity,
    so Newton proved that all Religious people are Mad,
    and men like Washington, Jefferson, Adams, and Franklin all warned you about them,
    and now that the United States has been Conquered by these Religious Satanic Liars,
    its Constitution was Abolished till its National Debt is paid off,
    which was Ironic that they put Newton in charge of the Mint knowing how Evil Money is,
    and how much Newton hated the use of Money, and Taxation just like Jesus Bar Abbas,
    so as it turns out,
    the Teaching of Jesus was about Money and Taxation,
    and nothing to do with Religion,
    Bar/Abbas was a Warrior who fought for Freedom,
    and the Christians Banished Newton&#39;s Science because they are all Cowards, and Liars,
    and as the author of this book,
    the views of Sir Isaac Newton do reflex as the views of the author,
    I like Newton before me,
    only write about the Truth and Facts we can Prove.

<p class="small">
    Sir Isaac Newton learned from Kepler,
    and Galilei,
    and expanded on their Knowledge,
    stating that he stood on the Shoulders of Giants,
    and not just to put down the smallness of Robert Hooke,
    as well as others that stole or disagreed with his work,
    he was very short-tempered,
    and was known to dress people down,
    as well as teaching empty classrooms,
    because he felt people were not intelligent enough to attend his courses,
    in his honor, I carry on the Tradition,
    and only teach Sheep.
</p>

<p class="small">
    Newton wrote many notes that are now Public Domain,
    for the most part,
    most of what he wrote was not understandable,
    unless you know Witchcraft,
    since he often wrote using it,
    as did Kepler, Galilei, and even Tesla,
    who took it to new levels.

    Newton wrote that the Church is the Strong Arm for the Banks that Print the Money,
    well, I Paraphrased,
    Newton used much stronger words,
    he said that Jesus Bar Abbas defeated the Roman Empire,
    and that no one would use Money for 3 Centuries after the Church Murdered Bar/Abbas,
    and that is when the Church inserted Christ into the Bible,
    and rewrote it to make Money less Evil,
    and make Bar/Abbas out to be a Bad Person,
    for defending people that are being sent to the Roman Coliseum,
    where they will be Murdered for Paid Entertainment,
    he said it is much like the story of how Moses,
    Raped, Murdered, then Plundered from his Foster Parents,
    proving only Satanic People would follow him,
    but that is how the Church works,
    it states you must Murder,
    also known as Sending to Hell,
    which means to burn them at the Stake,
    if a person does not believe as the Church Dictates,
    proving again how Evil it is,
    and how Satanic the whole Organization is,
    and why Newton ripped into them so hard,
    because he knew they were Satan&#39;s Helpers,
    and that the Antichrist is actually the Savior,
    that Jesus Bar Abbas said he would return as in the Flesh,
    at the End of Time,
    and that time as passed,
    since it as the Age of Pisces,
    which ended in the year 2012,
    so where is Jesus in the Flesh?

    Not hard to find,
    just look for a Wizard that is against the Teaching of Christ.
</p>

<p class="small">
    Newton was clear about what the Church was all about,
    the Church that Murdered Jesus Bar Abbas for defeating the Roman Empire,
    so the Church inserted Christ into the Bible,
    and tried to convince people that Christ was always in the Bible,
    yet Newton proved that was a Lie,
    stating that is how the Church Controls its Sheep,
    making it clear they endorsed the Science based on the Unproven Theory by Albert Einstein,
    who in the Theory,
    explained how the Universe would work,
    if God did not Exist,
    which is what the Church has been teaching for thousands of years now,
    so it is no wonder they bought off on a Theory that has not been proven in over a Century,
    proving how insane that Theory is,
    since it can not exist without Paradoxes,
    and this is why all Witches,
    and Wizards,
    are against the Church,
    since they hunt them down,
    and Murder them,
    I think it is clear why.

    The Ashkenazi Masonic Secret was that the Church destroyed Kepler&#39;s Grave,
    and all the work of his they could get their Evil hands on.

    Witchcraft is the Art of Writing in a way that has two or more meanings,
    and Newton spent most of his life learning it,
    so he could decode the Bible,
    and was the first person to write about the Bible Code.
</p>

<p class="small">
    Newton was Autistic,
    in the high functioning spectrum,
    known as Aspie,
    I found out I was one in 2000,
    at age 39,
    but never knew what it meant till after I watched the BBC Special &#8220;The Last Magician&#8221;,
    in July 2013,
    so this video changed my life,
    after being hit in the head by a Micrometeorite in May of this year,
    the thought of Newton being hit in the head by an Apple,
    was Gods joke on the two of us,
    and I do believe in God,
    and did take this as my Sign,
    as for Isaac Newton,
    he is a Relative to me, in the sense my Cousin was named after him,
    and he is Family to me,
    and I inherit more than just his knowledge he wrote of,
    but also his Autism, in the same Spectrum even,
    and maybe that is why I understand him better than most people,
    who thought that he was just honoring God,
    by writing that God is the Force of Gravity in All his Equations,
    but Newton only wrote what he meant,
    and only wrote about what he could Prove,
    and why I wrote this Book,
    to Honor him, and all those other Wizards in History.
</p>

<p class="small">
    Sir Isaac Newton wrote a lot about his relationship with other people,
    he had very few real friends,
    and the ones he had,
    he loved very much,
    and letters that he wrote,
    may have been mistaken for a love interest,
    but Newton was very clear that he never had sex in his whole life,
    and before he died,
    he said he had never masturbated,
    and would die a virgin.

    I understand how his letters may have sounded,
    and if not for actually having read everything I could about Newton,
    I may have wondered myself,
    but in this way, I do understand Newton,
    I love all my closes friends,
    and have no issue telling them that,
    but like Newton,
    I am not gay.

    I was in the Military,
    that is the only time I had male Roommates,
    but in Newtons time,
    it was quite common to have roommates,
    and I must set the record straight on Newton&#39;s behalf,
    because anyone that says Newton was Gay,
    is a Liar.

<p class="small">
    Known for a Comet named after him: Halley&#39;s Comet,
    that his best Friend Sir Isaac Newton calculated for him one day when they were smoking Cannabis,
    which Halley wrote more about Cannabis then the Comet he is known for.

    Halley entered College in Oxford in 1673,
    Halley visited the Royal Greenwich Observatory,
    where Flamsteed worked,
    and was appointed astronomer royal in 1676,
    and there Halley was encouraged to study astronomy.

    Halley was influenced by Flamsteed&#39;s use of the telescope to compile an accurate catalog of northern stars,
    Halley proposed to do the same for the Southern Hemisphere.

    With financial assistance from his father and,
    from King Charles II,
    he sailed in November 1676 in a ship of the East India Company,
    having left Oxford without his degree,
    he set sail for the island of St. Helena,
    the southernmost territory under British rule, in the South Atlantic.

    Halley encountered Bad weather his whole expectations,
    but when he left for home in January 1678,
    he had recorded the celestial longitudes,
    and latitudes of 341 stars,
    observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun&#39;s disk,
    made numerous pendulum observations,
    and noticed that some stars apparently had become fainter since their observation in antiquity.

    Halley&#39;s star catalog, published late in 1678,
    was the first of such work to be published containing telescopically determined locations of southern stars,
    and it established his reputation as an astronomer.

    In 1678 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and,
    with the intercession of the king, was granted the M.A. degree from the University of Oxford.

    In 1684 Halley made his first visit to Isaac Newton in Cambridge,
    which led to his prominent role in the development of the theory of gravitation.

    Halley and Newton were attempting to find a mechanical explanation for planetary motion,
    their problem was to determine what forces would keep a planet in a forward motion around the Sun,
    without either flying off into space or falling into the Sun.

    Halley had reasoned that the force keeping a planet in orbit must decrease as the inverse of the square of its distance from the Sun,
    they were not able to deduce from this hypothesis a theoretical orbit that would match the observed planetary motions,
    Newton told Halley he had already solved the problem, the orbit would be an ellipse,
    but that he had mislaid his calculations to prove it.

    Encouraged by Halley, Newton then expanded his studies on celestial mechanics into one of the greatest masterpieces produced by the mind of man,
    the Principia.

    The Royal Society decided that &#8220;Mr. Halley undertake the business of looking after it, and printing it at his own charge&#8221;,
    which he proceeded to do,
    he consulted with Newton, tactfully subdued a priority dispute between Newton and Hooke,
    edited the text of the Principia,
    wrote laudatory verse in Latin for the preface to honour its author,
    corrected the proofs, and saw it through to the press in 1687.

    Born: 6 January 1706 Julian Calendar<br />
    Born in: Boston, Massachusetts, North America<br />
    Died: 17 April 1790 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<br />
    Education: Boston Latin School.

<p class="small">
    He was known for Flying a Kite in a Lightning Storm to Prove Sir Isaac Newton was Right about God being in Lightning.
    In the winter of 1746-47,
    Franklin and three of his friends began to investigate electrical phenomena,
    Franklin sent reports of his ideas and experiments to Peter Collinson, his Quaker correspondent in London,
    and in 1751 Collinson published Franklin&#39;s papers in an 86-page book titled Experiments and Observations on Electricity,
    by the 18th century, the book went through five English editions, three in French, and one each in Italian and German.
</p>

<p class="small">
    Franklin made the distinction between insulators and conductors,
    and he invented a battery for storing electrical charges,
    and he also coined new English words for the new science of electricity:
    conductor, charge, discharge, condense, armature, electrify, as well as others,
    and he showed that electricity was a single fluid,
    with positive and negative or plus and minus charges and not,
    as traditionally thought, two kinds of fluids,
    and he demonstrated that the plus and minus charges,
    or states of electrification of bodies,
    had to occur in exactly equal amounts,
    a crucial scientific principle is known today as the law of conservation of charge.
    Unfortunately, even despite the success of his electrical experiments,
    Franklin never thought science was as important as public service.

    Franklin was known for many inventions: Lightning rod,
    Franklin stove, a wood-burning stove that warmed American homes for more than 200 years,
    he invented bifocal glasses, the odometer,
    and the glass harmonica called an armonica.

    He had ideas about everything from the nature of the Gulf Stream to the cause of the common cold,
    He suggested the notions of matching grants,
    and Daylight Saving Time,
    and he helped to create a civic society for the inhabitants of Philadelphia,
    and he helped to establish new institutions that people now take for granted:
    a fire company, a library, an insurance company, an academy, and a hospital,
    and he also was one of the first to petition congress to outlaw Slavery.
</p>

<p class="small">
    My Cousin Benjamin Franklin Flesher wrote about the man he was named after,
    he wrote that Franklin did not want to let the South add the clause,
    that Only Congress could Print Money,
    he argued that it would create a loophole for Lawyers to exploit,
    but the South refused to sign it, without it,
    and Congress was very upset over Franklin Grand Standing on this one issue,
    then John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, who either one liked Franklin,
    most because of his ties with the German, French, and especially England,
    but they added a clause to allow the Militia to take back a Corrupt Government,
    I might point out that President Bush made that Article Treason,
    and I have 16 George Bush&#39;s in my Family Tree,
    and they all had a different view about what was Treason,
    like allowing the Banks to Print Money instead of Congress,
    just ask JFK why only Dead Presidents are on it.

    Death: 29 June 1841 (Age 44) in Goose Island, Mason, West Virginia, USA (Note: Family was given Bounty)<br />
    In 1859 Isaac Newton&#39;s widowed wife Elizabeth:
    who was allowed bounty land on Goose Island in satisfaction for the Military Services rendered by:
    Isaac Newton Flesher in the War of 1812.<br />

<p class="small">
    Like most Ashkenazic Jews, Isaac Newton was named after dead relatives,
    which is why he named one of his sons Benjamin Franklin.
    Isaac was the first person to decode Sir Isaac Newton&#39;s notes to my knowledge,
    I inherited papers he wrote about Science and the World,
    topics that covered Masonic Legends, the Bible and work of other Wizards.

<p class="small">
    Nikola Tesla developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission we use today,
    and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse,
    who was a Thief just like Thomas Edison,
    who took his work, without paying for it,
    and the American financier J.P. Morgan,
    took everything that Tesla had.

    In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology,
    in 1898 Tesla invented a teleautomatic boat guided by remote control,
    from May 1899 until early 1900, Tesla made his most important discovery,
    terrestrial stationary waves,
    this discovery proved that Earth could be used as a conductor,
    and made to resonate at a certain electrical frequency,
    he lit 200 lamps without wires from a distance of 25 miles,
    and created man-made lightning, producing flashes measuring 135 feet,
    in 1891 he first noted that heat resulted from irradiation of tissue with high-frequency alternating current,
    with wavelengths somewhat longer than the longest radio waves, and pointed out its possible medical uses,
    and claimed of having invented a death ray capable of destroying 10,000 airplanes at a distance of 250 miles.
</p>

<p class="small">
    People make wild claims that they have perfected some Tesla Technology that creates Free Energy,
    Tesla himself never wrote of such devices,
    his concept of Free Energy,
    meant to Transmit it, and People could use it for Free.

    Tesla argued that the devices you sell can monitor power usage,
    but the Bank said people will find a way around it,
    and steel the Power,
    hate to tell you this,
    but my Dad, who is now dead,
    showed me how to take an Electrical Meter off an old pole,
    and put it on our house after the Electric Company turned off the Power,
    because he did not pay the bill,
    and how you can just wrap an Extension cord around a high voltage power line,
    and the Induction would give you the correct voltage,
    depending on how many times you wrap it around the wire,
    so it is easy to steel power,
    so the Bank did not do it for that reason,
    they did it to control people,
    and Tesla knew that.
</p>

<p class="small">
    Most people never understood Nikola Tesla,
    besides the fact, he had a very high IQ,
    and was Autistic, also known as an Aspie,
    he also like to drink Alcohol,
    and use Cannabis,
    I say to use because he liked Newton&#39;s idea,
    of making Cannabis Tea using Alcohol,
    and even got into Alchemy,
    just to learn about Newtons experiments,
    so he spent most of his life,
    learning about Witchcraft,
    and used it at all times,
    he spoke using Witchcraft,
    making him a True Wizard.

    When people would talk to him,
    he would reply using Witchcraft,
    so most of what he said could be taken in at least two different ways,
    making people wonder what he just said,
    leading some to believe he was going insane,
    having become so paranoid,
    that his only form of communication,
    came down to a Homing Pigeon,
    and no one ever figured out who he was communicating with,
    but it was clear that he keeps up his experiments,
    in the New Yorker Hotel, he lived in,
    it had a massive Electrical Generator,
    and the whole building was built just like his experiment at Wharncliffe Tower,
    which are just now starting to be used,
    it was a Wireless Power Tower,
    he was planning on using the two points to broadcast Electricity,
    to the World for Free.

    Nikola Tesla was a firm believer that we are All Light Beings,
    in a body made of Flesh,
    and that Light is Everything,
    and I have proved he was right.

    Education: University of Vienna <br />
    Due to his earlier work on Autism Spectrum disorders,
    Asperger Syndrome (AS), was named after him,

</p>

<p class="small">
    Born in Vienna, Asperger published the first definition of Asperger&#39;s Syndrome in 1944.
    He identified a pattern of behavior,
    and abilities that he called &#8220;Autistic Psychopathy&#8221;,
    meaning: Autism (self), and Psychopathy (personality),
    the pattern included:
    &#8220;
        A lack of empathy, little ability to form friendships,
        one-sided conversation, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements.
    &#8221;
    Asperger called children with <span class="small">&#8220;AS&#8221;</span> &#8220;Little Professors&#8221;,
    because of their ability to talk about their favorite subject in great detail.<br />

<h4 id="jeffrey_scott_flesher_military_duty" class="a_ref">Military Duty</h4>

<p class="small">
    Enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1984,
    from 1985 to 1993,
    (E)FF-111 Avionics Test Station,
    worked as an Electronics Technician, Electronic Engineer,
    and Computer Programmer,
    Avionics package,
    including the Attack RADAR System,
    Terrain Following Computer, and HQ4 Radios.

    Extra duties included being a member of the United States Air Force Honor Guard,
    was on CNN News while doing the Boise Submarine Inauguration Speech in Boise Idaho,
    with Joe Albertson, of Albertsons chain of grocery stores.

    I was a CPR instructor,
    and a Self-Aid and Buddy Care Instructor (Combat Emergency Medical Technician [EMT]).

    During the Gulf War, the (E)F-111 flew over 96% of all sorties flown during the War,
    making it the most important Aircraft during the Gulf War.

    I received a Meritorious Service Medal for improving the (E)F-111 by 30%,
    after the Gulf War,
    the (E)F-111 was no longer needed,
    so I cross-trained as a Helicopter Crew Chief,
    because as a child,
    I wanted to be in Air Rescue, and Special Operations,
    and I loved to fly in Helicopters.

    From 1993 to 1997 I served as a Helicopter Crew Chief on the MH-60 in the 66 RQS Rescue Squadron at Nellis AFB,
    and in Kuwait during Desert Storm,
    including Operation Southern Watch, and Operation Vigilant Warrior,
    and on the MH-53 in the 31<sup>st</sup> Special Operations Black Knights Squadron,
    at Oson AB Korea.

    I received my second Meritorious Service Medal with Oat Leaf Cluster for improving Special Operations.

    My last year in the Air Force,
    I worked in the Maintenance Operation Center (MOC),
    it normally sits under the Command Operation Center,
    by under I mean as in the basement,
    they say that job, is more stressful than Air Traffic Control,
    and I believe them.

    My job was to track all the Air Rescue Helicopters,
    I was the person I used to call on the Radio,
    when I worked on the Flight line,
    anytime I need Fuel,
    or needed clarence to taxi onto the runway to Fly,
    my job included all the Maintenance Operations on all the Aircraft at Nellis Air Force Base,
    and not just the Helicopters,
    it was more of a special assignment task,
    they had my priority.

    I was Medically Retired after problems,
    do to an accident I got into,
    where I injured my back for the third time,
    coupled with the fact that I had permanent Vertigo,
    probably from the Anthrax Vaccine,
    so I could no longer fly,
    nor could I work due to my back.

<p class="text_indent">
    About the Author, written by the Author,
    so this is about Me talking about me.

    As a child, I viewed the World of Adults as Chaos,
    each of them thinking they are individuals,
    and that they actually had a Right to believe whatever they wanted,
    yet if people want to believe in things that make others believe they are insane,
    they can be locked up in a Metal Ward,
    that is what my Step-Mother told me anyway,
    and she should know,
    she needed to be locked up in one,
    strange how my Steps did not think that,
    and only my little sister and I did,
    we had the Wicked Step-Mother Syndrome.

    I had no idea I was Autistic till I was 39 years old,
    but my Step-Mother did,
    and the way she dealt with my Meltdowns,
    was to make me Smoke Cannabis,
    so by the time, I was a Teenager,
    being High on Cannabis was normal for me,
    and I never gave it a break till after my Step-Mother Committed Suicide in front of me,
    not that I actually saw her get hit by the car,
    or wanted to go near it,
    listening to the Teenage Girl that hit her screaming,
    but I did imagine it,
    and that was enough to give me PTSD over that issue,
    so growing up I tended not to talk about it,
    and tried to forget about it for the longest time,
    no one can screw our minds up more than (Step) Parents,
    and people that say get over it,
    never did, sure you go on with your life,
    but you carry around all the baggage life has dealt you,
    and that may have been the reason I wanted to be a Helicopter Crew Chief,
    in Air Rescue, and Special Operations,
    because it was the most dangerous job in the Air Force,
    but that desire started when I was still a child,
    so I grew up and fulfilled my childhood dream.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    As a child growing up with Drug Addicts,
    I learned a lot about people growing up,
    and they all basically thought the same way they were taught in School,
    but after the 3<sup>rd</sup> Grade I stopped paying attention,
    because all they were teaching me was Stupid,
    and I did not need to learn Stupid,
    I know that those that believe in Religion,
    or Theoretical Science,
    have no concept of what is Real,
    because of their Religion &#38; Science,
    teaches them God does Not Physically Exist,
    and that is Insane,
    yet People allow this Insanity in the Name of Religion &#38; Science,
    but according to my Step-Mother,
    they would lock people like me up,
    or burn us at the Stake,
    and History proves she was Right about that,
    so actually believing that God Exist,
    is insane to anyone that is Religious,
    or believe in Theoretical Science,
    making them Insane,
    but it is Legal Insanity,
    just call it Religion or Theoretical Science,
    and you can get away with thinking Insane,
    so I got to the point where I did not want to talk to those types of People,
    and have become Home Bound, a shut-in, or lock up,
    go sell crazy some other place, but leave me alone.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    As an Adult, the Child in me never died,
    maybe that is because I am Autistic,
    almost 20 years after finding out,
    I am still trying to figure it all out,
    at first, I thought it was because the Neurotypicals were all insane,
    but then I noticed that this Insanity is Global,
    and everyone can not be Neurotypical,
    so I figure most people can not think very clearly,
    or very deeply,
    because they bought into a Theory that can never be proven to be the Truth in over a Century,
    even Einstein said it could not work without God as the Force of Gravity,
    so why do most people believe in things that are not true,
    is because they are insane.

    Religion by Definition is the Belief in things that are not Real,
    and Theoretical means it is not a Fact or the Truth,
    and Amend means Minor Change,
    Only means Major Change,
    Printing the Money Instead of Congress,
    means they Own US,
    so it can not be the meaning of these words that is confusing people,
    yet they are Insane for believing in things that are not the Truth,
    so if it is not a Neurotypical thing,
    then it means there are no Intelligent People on this Planet,
    except me of course,
    and those that believe me by extension,
    I am joking,
    but it is clear I do not understand Stupidity.

    My only Goal in Writing this Book,
    was to prove how Stupid Yew are,
    seriously, that is why I repeated myself,
    told the same story over a different way,
    made up some Theory about how the Galaxy was formed,
    as if I have a clue,
    I am only Human,
    and although God is in all the Atoms in my Cells,
    I still do not have a Cell Phone to talk to God with,
    and that Joke never gets old,
    and why I find it amusing that I took an Oath to Protect the Constitution,
    knowing it was suspended in 1861,
    100 years before I was born,
    but I took my Oath Seriously,
    and wrote this book, and more like it,
    with a Goal to pay down the National Debt,
    and therefore Defending &#38; Protecting the Constitution,
    that includes stopping the Lie about it being Amended,
    that means Minor Change,
    and Only Congress can Print Money was not negotiable,
    it is Treason,
    and I took an Oath to make sure that Treason is known to all,
    not to keep this a Dirty Secret,
    knowing that the United States of America does not Exist,
    only a Privately owned Corporation known as just U.S., or UNITED STATES,
    and there is no Justice in JustUS,
    because no one has any Rights,
    under a Constitution that is Suspended,
    and therefore there is no Freedom,
    just Freedumb.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    When it comes to Education,
    for the most part,
    I was self-taught,
    I went to school,
    never studied,
    never did my homework,
    and if I ever did good on a test,
    I would have to worry about going to a special school,
    so I had no incentive to do good in school,
    and went to College feeling the same way,
    but I still got all my College Credits,
    but like Tesla, I could not find a School that would except my PhD,
    because it is based on God,
    and not the God,
    nor the Science that the Banks want their Sheep to know,
    because the Truth will set you Free,
    and why I believe all Schools only teach Dumb,
    and it is not for Free,
    but most Sheeple have no problem having to pay for Freedom.

    The only Science that interested me,
    is that of what I call the Wizards: Kepler, Galilei, Newton,
    Franklin, and Tesla,
    so growing up, I only read their works,
    and why I have such a strange way of writing like them,
    I have no interest whatsoever in Theoretical Science,
    and people that try to debunk my Science with Theory,
    they are just Sheep to me,
    because this Science is not Theoretical,
    so you can not use Theories to debunk it,
    and only Intelligent people understand that,
    the only reason Newtons Math works,
    is because God is the Force of Gravity,
    all I did was prove it again,
    but Sheeple and their Theories will never End,
    only the Insane would believe in a Theory that no one could prove in over a Century.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    I have little hope for the Human Race,
    they are nothing but Sheep,
    who only believe what they have heard in their herd,
    and those that do not plan for the future will not have one,
    so those that do not plan to survive,
    do not deserve to survive the Polar Shift,
    like all the other animals that could not learn to survive on this planet,
    they too, will become bones someone else will dig up,
    some day in the future,
    someone will dig up those poor fools who were buried in the Ground,
    and they will wonder why we went extinct,
    and the root cause will be Money,
    so the Bible was right about many things,
    the Pole Shift,
    Satan telling half-truths,
    the Bible states God is All Light without Darkness,
    All means nothing else,
    yet every Religious person I have ever asked what God is,
    they always tell me God is the leader of the A-Team (Angels),
    and only Satan would tale you that,
    that is a half truth,
    actually it is a lie,
    in the Bible, all the Characters are real Stars,
    and Constellations,
    and not real People,
    anyone that tells you they are,
    are Liars,
    the Bible calls them Sheep,
    Newton called them Mad,
    but the Sheep will never admit they are Sheep,
    and Mainstream Sheep are the worse,
    they believe that Aircraft hit the Twin Towers,
    yet no one took a picture of it,
    and those fake videos were the worse CGI I have seen,
    besides my own, so I know bad CGI, Aircraft do not Ghost into objects,
    they crash into them,
    yet there are no videos of any Aircraft crashing into the Twin Towers,
    instead, they have videos that could not have been videoed from where they said they were,
    and what looks the Aircraft disappeared into a black hole,
    leaving no evidence behind.

    As a Child I remember thinking about going to the Moon,
    I imagined the surface of the Moon,
    to be constantly bombarded by Micrometeorites,
    and Solar Radiation,
    I figured that even if you had a foot of lead to protect you from the Solar Radiation,
    the electromagnetic flux would cause dust particles to cling to you,
    making it hard to walk or drive-in,
    look at the lunar rocks, full of microscopic holes,
    much like Swiss cheese,
    and what you face would look like if you would stand on the Moon,
    with only Aluminum Foil and Plastic to protect you,
    this was years before this TV show came on,
    and they said we when to the Moon,
    and everyone thought it was real,
    like we actually went to the Moon,
    at first I thought it was a joke Adults like to play,
    hey everyone, I want to play we went to the Moon,
    using only Plastic and Aluminum Foil,
    how Stupid do they think children are,
    Adults are as stupid as they come,
    you are born with as many brain cells you will have all your life,
    most people used theirs up drinking Alcohol,
    the fact is that Humans can not live without Earth-Like Magnetic Force,
    and that force is diminishing by the day,
    and it will be gone by the year 2103,
    unless the Earth Reverses its Poles,
    so I have a good understanding that by the time you get to the Moon,
    there is only enough Gravity around the Moon,
    to support small Satellites,
    if they have a magnetic signature,
    but not enough Magnetic Strength to maintain a human life.

    Physics is absolute,
    the fact is that Humans require Earths Magnetic Force,
    and at the rate it is weakening,
    everyone should be worried,
    the fact they are not,
    is proof of how stupid they really are,
    not just for believing what they watch on TV,
    instead of walking outside and looking up,
    you could actually see the Apollo Module as it orbited the Earth,
    it was easy to see,
    back in those days,
    there were not as many,
    so they stuck out,
    so people are too stupid to believe what they saw,
    because everyone I knew was talking about it,
    but everyone believed the news,
    and they said it was not the Apollo,
    they did not say what it was,
    and tried to make it sound technical,
    so stupid people would say oh that explains it.

    As a Child, I was taught to be very afraid of Needles with Syringes,
    having seen people die with them in their arms,
    the life of Drug Addict Parents,
    gave me a different viewpoint of society,
    and I viewed Vaccines the same way,
    and I found a way around them till I came into the Military,
    so I was getting them for the first time,
    and Vaccines do not work,
    and 50-year study 20 years ago,
    is now pushing 70,
    yet Vaccines are still mandatory,
    and all they are,
    is a form of population control,
    and to dumb down the population,
    so they believe they have Freedom,
    when all they have is Freedumb,
    so the Vaccines are doing something,
    they are making people Dumber,
    as if that is possible,
    most of them are just above the Minimal IQ Level as it is,
    and that is only because they have to lower the minimal score every year,
    to keep up with the rate that people are being dumb down at,
    and now you can get these dumb vaccines for Free,
    and this is the only Freedumb the Sheep have.

<p class="text_indent">
    I know what I know because I prove everything I know to myself,
    few people do that,
    they just except the World as the Bankers want them too,
    because once you understand that this is all Treason under the Constitution,
    you understand why Lincoln got a Bullet in the Head by the Militia,
    so I have no delusions about the Government I live under,
    knowing the Militia is Treason to them,
    as is taking back the Constitution,
    so the only Chance of Freedom is Trinary Sanctuary,
    so I spent most of my life designing it.

<p class="text_indent">
    The way I look at History, is from the notes of Wizards like Kepler,
    who only wanted to know the date that Jesus Christ was born,
    only to find out that there never was a Jesus Christ,
    only Jesus Bar Abbas, 
    and I think deep down, everyone knows this is the truth,
    anyone that has studied history knows it is full of lies,
    but this lie could get you killed, 
    the Church is very protective,
    and has people called Templars, 
    or Knights Templar,
    also known as the Order of Solomon&#39;s Temple, 
    they were a Catholic Military Order,
    dating back to the fourth century,
    it was a Secret Organization for over a thousand years,
    and their job was to make sure all the pre-Christ Bibles got burned,
    along with the people that had it,
    that is where the Burn them at the Stake came from,
    Kepler wrote about them,
    as did Newton.
    
    Kepler wrote that true Christianity was the celebration of the Zodiac,
    and centered around the Star that Christ was born under,
    but once Kepler found out that Christ was actually Jesus Bar Abbas,
    he knew he had to be careful who he talks to,
    and how he does his research,
    and was always running from the Church,
    and the Knights Templar.
    
    The Zodiac was removed at the same time Christ was inserted,
    Newton found this out from Kepler&#39;s notes,
    they were part of the Ashkenazi Masonic Order that Kepler started,
    when he discovered that Christ was inserted into the Bible,
    and the Zodiac was removed,
    so that people would believe that the Bible is talking about people,
    instead of Stars, and Zodiac Constellations,
    12 People at the Last Supper, 
    also 12 Zodiac Signs,
    one each,
    named after them,
    and historically,
    Jesus Bar Abbas was Martyrized,
    meaning someone killed him, because of his beliefs,
    which was that God was Light,
    the Romans would kill those that believed God was Light,
    so Christianity died with Bar/Abbas.
    
    Kepler learned that they tried to change the Bible,
    fully aware of the Bible Code,
    Kepler said that the Code was altered,
    and said that Michel de Nostredame, also known as Nostradamus,
    used the Bible Code to make all his predictions,
    but keep it Secret,
    knowing about the Knights Templar,
    so there is no Mystery around Nostradamus,
    he just knew how to Read and Write Witchcraft,
    and you would be Burned Alive if caught,
    even Newton knew this.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The First Rule about History,
    is that those who Conquered,
    wrote it,
    and they always make themselves look good in the process,
    because they believed they were doing the Right thing,
    that is how all Wars are Fought,
    and all Wars have been Holy Wars,
    all because of a man named Jesus Bar Abbas.
    
    The Truth that Kepler wrote about him,
    was mostly from the Bible,
    it turns out they did not change it all that much,
    mainly because of the Bible Code,
    so they instead just inserted things into it,
    making two Jesus&#39;s in the process,
    they knew if they tried to remove Bar/Abbas,
    everyone would know,
    no getting around that,
    but inserting Christ,
    then forcing it down everyone&#39;s throat,
    was what the Knights Templar were good at,
    they enforced the Law of the Church.
    
    Newton dug deeper than Kepler did,
    and found himself having to live two lives,
    in one he was Sir Isaac Newton,
    in another,
    he was a Wizard,
    who studied Witchcraft,
    and from what both Kepler and Newton wrote,
    Witchcraft was just a way of hiding what is known as Alchemy,
    nowadays they call it Chemistry,
    or Science,
    which were no allowed by the Church,
    they would send you to Hell,
    meaning you will be Burned at the Stake,
    and why Newton burned a lot of Papers,
    when he felt it was getting close for him to die.
    
    Newton wrote that only the Church teaches that God is a Deity that does not Physically Exist,
    he called them Mad,
    because it is insane to believe in things that do not Exist,
    and the Bible clearly states that only Sheep would believe the Stories,
    as if that stopped People from identifying as a Sheep,
    and why I only Write this for Sheep,
    not that Religious People want to hear that they have been Worshiping Satan,
    because Kepler made it very clear,
    the Teaching that God is anything other than All Light,
    is Satanic,
    the Bible states this,
    and if you put back the Zodiac Canon,
    you would understand this.
    
    God is not a make-believe Being,
    God is a Light Being,
    as are all Humans,
    Tesla wrote that,
    I have proved that the Bible only states that God is All Light without Darkness,
    All mean that God is not the Name of an Angle,
    but Satan is,
    and that is who runs the Church that Murdered Jesus Bar Abbas,
    and inserted Christ,
    making the Bible nothing but a Lie,
    just so they can Control you with Religion or Money. 
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    I know for a fact that the Bank,
    and the Church,
    got together to decide that Albert Einstein was Right,
    and Sir Isaac Newton was Wrong,
    just to hide the fact that the Church and Money are Evil,
    and after over a Century,
    not one of Einstein&#39;s Theories have been proven,
    meaning that it is not the Truth,
    a Theory is never the Truth,
    only Facts are,
    and there are no Facts in the Godless Dynamic Universe, 
    just Paradoxes that cannot exist in Reality.
    
    There is no convincing anyone that Newton was Right,
    and Einstein could not be more Wrong,
    that is just as hard as convincing anyone that Christ was inserted into the Bible,
    so really there was no reason to try to hide it,
    Stupid is what Stupid Does,
    and Stupid will think Stupid,
    and try to make others Stupid,
    because Stupid believes anything without any Facts,
    and why I only wrote this for Yew,
    because this Guard Dog is getting tired of Stupid,
    and that is why I would rather sit alone in a room,
    and write to a Stupid Sheep like Yew. 
    
    The Difference between 160 and 180 IQ is huge,
    so much so, that they have nothing in common,
    and nothing to talk about,
    since anything a person with 180 IQ things about,
    is way over the head of someone with only 160 IQ,
    and that is why people like Kepler, Newton or Tesla,
    seem out of place,
    and out of time,
    Legend has it that only one true Genius exist on the Planet at any point in time,
    and that is why no one appreciates them when they are here,
    because no one is Intelligent enough to know the are here.

<p class="text_indent">
    When I was in the Military,
    in the Honor Guard,
    during a function dinner,
    at Mountain Home Air Force Base,
    an Officer made a toast to the United States Constitution,
    and Kathryn Albertson saluted and added may it rest in peace,
    as most of the people at the table said hear, hear, 
    this Officer looked like someone slapped him in the face, 
    so I said to him,
    you need to read the fine print,
    at the time I was paraphrasing the General Enumeration of Powers Act,
    I was in Jail for a PTSD attack and someone gave me this statement,
    US CODE of FEDERAL LAW TITLE 12 CHAPTER 3 SUBCHAPTER 9 SUBSECTION 341,
    you can find it at the White House under US Code,
    <a id="r_uscode_https_blank_target_link" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title12/chapter3/subchapter9&#38;edition=prelim" class="https_blank_target_link">https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title12/chapter3/subchapter9&#38;edition=prelim</a>,
    so see who the Enumeration of the Powers Act puts in Charge,
    and I know most people never read the Law,
    the do not even Read the Bible,
    if they did, 
    they would know it was only written for Sheep,
    and so is this book,
    so let me explain US Code of Law,
    that come from the White House,
    the one at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20006,
    so keep in mind the audience I am talking to,
    Military, top Government Officials, 
    and our guess of Honor, the Albertson&#39;s,
    who just toasted to the end of our Constitution,
    and everyone got it, but a few,
    so let me explain this.
</p>

<p>
    First. To adopt and use a corporate seal. 
    $ That is a U and an S, superimposed on top of each other.
</p>

<p>
    Second. To have succession after February 25, 1927, until dissolved by Act of Congress or until forfeiture of franchise for violation of law.

    This one basically states that the Federal Reserve is a Franchise,
    and in 1933 they dissolved Congress,
    and then they stole all the Gold in the Country,
    and forfeited the Country,
    and it filled Bankruptcy, and we are still running under that status,
    since we cannot make the Bank Payment.
    
    We the Sheeple of the United States,
    bought into this Franchise with our Blood,
    and would die defending it,
    and why so many pretend we have a Constitution,
    cause stupid Sheep do not understand the meaning of Only,
    as in Only Congress can Print Money,
    a loophole in the Constitution,
    and why my Family refused to sign it,
    and now it is just a relic,
    it was suspended 100 years before my birth,
    in the year of 1861,
    so I was born into Slavery,
    and had no say so as to owns me,
    and Me is just short for Meat,
    so it is the Flesh,
    and that is my name,
    and what Jesus Bar Abbas said he would come back as,
    once again,
    to fight for Real Freedom,
    and not the kind of Freedumb the United States enjoys so much,
    but it is Free,
    and Sheep never get enough of Being Dumb.
    
    The Officer looked at me like I need to keep my mouth shut,
    but Kathryn said go on, as Joe squeezed her hand,
    tell us about the 8 Enumerated Planks of Slavery...
</p>

<p>
    Third. To make contracts.
    
    All Masonic Orders are Numbered,
    and the First 3 are always Free,
    and that is where the Term Free Mason came from,
    during the Civil War the Bank made a Contract with the North and the South,
    and funded both,
    no caring who won,
    because everyone already lost the Country.
</p>

<p>
    Fourth. To sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law or equity.
    
    This is the Whole Game,
    Sue.
</p>

<p>
    Fifth. To appoint by its board of directors a president, vice presidents, 
    and such officers and employees as are not otherwise provided for in this chapter, 
    to define their duties, require bonds for them and fix the penalty thereof, 
    and to dismiss at pleasure such officers or employees. 
    
    The president shall be the chief executive officer of the Bank and shall be appointed by the Class B and Class C directors of the bank, 
    with the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for a term of 5 years; 
    and all other executive officers and all employees of the Bank shall be directly responsible to the president. 
    
    The first vice president of the Bank shall be appointed in the same manner and for the same term as the president, 
    and shall, in the absence or disability of the president or during a vacancy in the office of president, 
    serve as chief executive officer of the bank. Whenever a vacancy shall occur in the office of the president or the first vice president, 
    it shall be filled in the manner provided for original appointments; 
    and the person so appointed shall hold office until the expiration of the term of his predecessor.
    
    First off, the President of the United States, falls under employees as are not otherwise provided for in this chapter,
    and that is because the United States is in Default on a loan they took from the Bank,
    using the Country and all its Citizens as Collateral.
</p>

<p>
    Sixth. To prescribe by its board of directors, bylaws not inconsistent with law, 
    regulating the manner in which its general business may be conducted, 
    and the privileges granted to it by law may be exercised and enjoyed.
    
    This means the Banks are allowed to have Fun at the Expense of all its Slaves,
    they own the Courts, and all the Judges and Lawyers.
</p>

<p>
    Seventh. To exercise by its board of directors, or duly authorized officers or agents, 
    all powers specifically granted by the provisions of this chapter and such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking within the limitations prescribed by this chapter.
    
    That means they have the Power to do anything it takes to keep the Banking going.
</p>

<p>
    Eighth. Upon deposit with the Treasurer of the United States of any bonds of the United States in the manner provided by existing law relating to national banks, 
    to receive from the Secretary of the Treasury circulating notes in blank, registered and countersigned as provided by law, 
    equal in amount to the par value of the bonds so deposited, 
    such notes to be issued under the same conditions and provisions of law as relate to the issue of circulating notes of national banks secured by bonds of the United States bearing the circulating privilege, 
    except that the issue of such notes shall not be limited to the capital stock of such Federal reserve bank.
    
    We the Sheeple of the United States of America, are now property of the Bank, and will do what they say.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Another round of Hear, Hear.
    
    The Military takes its orders from the President of the United States,
    that of America part, no longer applies,
    the President of the United States,
    is just a Puppet for the Bank,
    the way it works is that the President of the Federal Reserve Bank,
    puts on a long Glove,
    and sticks it up the rear end of all the Leaders of the World,
    and makes them say what every they want,
    and they do not mess around,
    the Gloves never come off.
    
    This officer looks at me and said,
    what do you know, 
    you are just a Sergeant,
    at which point Kathryn spook up,
    and said I did not mean to start an argument,
    but the facts are the facts,
    it does not matter how you read the Laws,
    it is more how you read into them that bothers me,
    it is like this business of two Jesus&#39;s in the Bible,
    you can argue about it all day and never solve anything,
    it is what it is.
    
    The officer looked like he wanted to ask about the two Jesus&#39;s,
    but did not, since every time he said something,
    it made him look Stupid.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    People who try to argue with me about facts,
    soon find out that they cannot engage me,
    without lying to make their point,
    for example, 
    Religious People will argue with me about Jesus,
    when the Bible is very clear about the subject,
    only Sheep believe in the Stories,
    the Bible is all about Witchcraft,
    and why the Church had Witch Hunts,
    the Knights Templar were all about keeping this Secret.
    
    Stupid Sheep think that a Theory is a way of explaining a fact,
    proving that they have no concept of Reality,
    they live in a world of Science Fiction,
    and they have no idea,
    that all of Einstein&#39;s Theories are just BS,
    first he steals all his Math while working in a Patent Office,
    he has no idea how the Math actually works,
    so when questioned about it,
    he says stupid stuff,
    for example, 
    he stated that he does not fundamentally change anything in the Newtonian Universe,
    this is the biggest lie in Science,
    because in the Newtonian Universe,
    Light is Static, and the Universe is Dynamic,
    and in all of Einstein&#39;s theories,
    he never has this configuration,
    in fact, he only goes from Light is Dynamic,
    and the Universe is Static,
    to everything is Dynamic,
    but there is one small flaw in his Theory,
    Light does not have any Acceleration,
    so it cannot be Dynamic,
    and the Newtonian Universe is based on God being the Force of Gravity,
    and in the Godless Dynamic Universe,
    there is no God,
    thus no Gravity,
    and there is no Curvature of the Space-Time Continuum,
    that is just Science Fiction,
    and that is what all Theory is.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    I have met a lot of famous people in my life,
    but I remember the day I first met Kathryn and Joe Albertson,
    I was just a child at the time,
    my Grandmother took me to this Mormon Church in Boise Idaho,
    there was a one hour reading from the notes of Joseph Smith Jr. who was the founder of the Church,
    I have read all his work by this point in my life,
    he believed that God was All Light without Darkness,
    and wrote a lot about Kepler and Newton,
    he was inducted into the Ashkenazi Masonic Order in 1823,
    and after reading all work of the Wizards,
    he dived into Witchcraft,
    and became one himself,
    but the Mormon Religion is another thing,
    and the two are not related,
    the Ashkenazi Masonic Order is a group of people,
    all of whom come from one of the 13 Lost Tribes,
    including the Ashkenazi, 
    but not limited to just that tribe,
    because the Blood line flows through all of us,
    but clearly Jews,
    meaning they are a mixed-race,
    Black, White, and all the Shades of Grey in between,
    and the Source of all Smith&#39;s Knowledge came from the Bible that Kepler handed down,
    it went from Galilei, to Newton, and down the line,
    I had it for a brief time,
    and have no idea where it is today,
    but on that day,
    it was in that Church,
    and my father told me that it was not Open to the Public,
    it was only Open to 33 Degree Masons,
    so I must have been one at a young age,
    because I could remember all the Verses in Order,
    or my family could not find a baby sitter,
    but it was clear to me then that Masons Rule this World.
    
    Joseph wrote that once people understand they are the Light of God,
    things will change,
    but the Christians were at War with him at the time of his writing,
    and they forced him to move,
    and that is why he did,
    so Under the Hood,
    Joseph wrote about Christ being Inserted into the Bible,
    and why he had to flee from the Christians,
    he said that Christianity was over,
    because People no longer read the Zodiac Canons,
    were 12 Constellations represent the 12 People at the Last Supper,
    what he described, I later came to understand was a Remote Controlled Spacecraft,
    the Bible Newton had was full of Spacecraft,
    and why some believe they were Aliens from Outer Space,
    but not Joseph, 
    he knew that was us,
    and all the Bible is,
    is the History of the 12 Zodiac Signs,
    the truth is that Jesus never had a Last Supper,
    nor did he have 12 Disciples,
    each is a Frequency, in 12 Semitones,
    for example,
    (<sup>2</sup>/<sub>1</sub>) * 16 = 32,
    this is known as a Perfect octave,
    it is an Augmented 7<sup>th</sup>,
    and they are order from 0 to 12,
    so 12 is actually the 13 Semitone,
    and how the 2 becomes 1,
    that is known as Math,
    and not Religion.
    
    Nowhere in his writing does he talk about God as a Spirit or a Deity,
    in fact, he detests it as much as Kepler or Newton,
    so for the most part,
    Joseph was a Scientist, and was not Religious.
    
    Years later when I was in the Air Force Honor Guard,
    we did functions, 
    one included the Albertsons,
    who I recognized immediately,
    my Commander introduced us,
    when Joe asked if I had any relationship to Herbert Flesher,
    I told him that was my Grandfather,
    and Kathryn said Jeffrey Scott Flesher,
    is that you?
    
    At which point my Commanders jaw needed to be manually shut,
    I think he had no idea they stopped his introduction before he said our names,
    and still had his mouth open to talk,
    and there were 4 of US, 
    Joe read the name plates faster then the Commander could.
    
    Later, after the event, 
    they invited me over to their home in Boise,
    near Boise State University,
    where I was working on my PhD in Physics,
    and had already finished all my basic requirements for it,
    and knew that it would never be accepted,
    and over a few years, Kathryn helped me,
    but it came down to what she said, 
    all the Universities are privately owned, 
    and they will never Accredit any Paper that deals with God as All Light,
    even if it is also the very foundation that Joseph Smith, or any Bible wrote about,
    Religion is one thing, Science is another,
    I understood what it was she was telling me,
    but I completely over thought the part about forming my own University,
    when I remembered what Kathryn said,
    Jesus never trusted the Church,
    he tried to teach there once,
    they only wanted to pass around the Plate to collect Money,
    because they worked for the Banks,
    that is why they got a Tax Exemption,
    so where do you think you would find Jesus?
    
    After what seemed like a long pause, I remembered from the Bible. 
    and said Jesus said he would come back in the Flesh,
    so where ever we are, so is he,
    because we are all in the Flesh,
    so I got my answer,
    I needed to start my own University, so I did.

    I only have one Message to tell the World,
    and that is that
    &#8220;
        I do not Care what Yew Believe,
        nor Does the Universe,
        Know it,
        or No it Not
    &#8221;,
    you can argue with my Trinary Universe,
    and if the Earth does not Reverse Poles,
    on my 100<sup>th</sup> birthday,
    we will see by the year 2103,
    that is 42 years later,
    remember I told you 42 Hex is 66 Decimal,
    so we will see who was Right,
    and who is Left.
