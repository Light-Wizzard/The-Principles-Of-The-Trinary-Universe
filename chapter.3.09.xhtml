<h3 id="chapter_03_09" class="a_header"> Chapter 3.09:<br />The Sun </h3>

<p class="text_top">
    The Sun is not Nuclear nor is it Compress Gas,
    the very concept that it is, is called insanity,
    Theories that can not be proven because they are simply not true,
    the fact is that the Sun does not produce Heat,
    during a Solar Minimum, this is obvious,
    proving the Sun is not Nuclear,
    its output depends on how much it eats,
    and by eating I mean Space Debris like Comets,
    Asteroids and other Space junk,
    the Sun Spot activity proves that at Solar Minimum,
    the Magnetic Energy is at its weakest, so it will not pull in as much debris,
    so its output will be diminished,
    it is because we are orbiting around the Galaxy,
    running into all the Garbage that is also orbiting around the Galaxy,
    so just look at Videos about the Sun and you will see its an Electromagnetic Field,
    and that is why I created a Video Series about the Sun,
    to prove that only Stupid People believe that it is not Light.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Sun is feeding all the Planets in its system,
    every decade it will reverse its Magnetic Field so that it can maintain a steady stream known as the Solar Winds,
    that carry all the ground up material to its target,
    which are Planets in its system that need more Material to Grow,
    so it eats so it can feed its Children,
    so the Sun is more like a Father or Mother,
    but the Father or Mother is known as the Galaxy,
    and it is job is similar, it feeds the Sun,
    and in turn, the Sun feeds all the Planets,
    and if the Planets give birth to its Moons,
    then it also makes them the Father and Mother also.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Sun travels in a Helix pattern around the Galaxy,
    its speed varies as it climbs away from the Galactic Plane,
    as it slows to the point at which it can no longer climb and the Gravity of the Galactic Plane pulls it back,
    and then it speeds up till it crashes into the Galactic Plane,
    which is a frozen debris field,
    filled with Space Junk that can not escape the Gravity Plane,
    so any Planet traveling through the Galactic Plane,
    will be pounded on by this Space Debris,
    and will exit the Galactic Plane as a frozen Planet,
    which will take thousands of years to defrost,
    so the Sun will be at Solar Maximum during this transition through the Galactic Plane.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Sun is another Sub Chapter that is too large a subject to cover,
    so it will require another book to fully explain the Sun,
    but for now,
    it is only important to understand what the Sun is,
    and that is the Earths Father and Mother,
    just like the Moon is the Earths Child,
    so it is a Living System of Planets,
    that are run by the Same Energy that runs us,
    so we are Related to the Sun,
    as we are Related to the Earth we Live on.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Sun is just a Trinary Energy,
    meaning that the Core of it,
    is the same as an Atom,
    only much larger,
    and it is easy to understand this analogy,
    currently Mainstream defines the Core of the Sun,
    as compress Hydrogen,
    this is because they believe the Sun is just a Match,
    and needs a Fuel to burn,
    so they believe that the Sun is on Fire,
    and I am not joking,
    this is how Stupid Mainstream Science really is,
    so let us look at the Sun,
    and see if it is really a Match on Fire,
    or if it acts more like an Atom.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Mainstream will never admit they are wrong about anything,
    yet their Theories are changing all the time,
    proving they are always wrong about everything,
    and why they are Mainstream,
    and why they never admit they are wrong.

    If you believe in Theories,
    then you deny facts,
    because a Theory can not explain a fact,
    because facts are things that were proven to be the Truth,
    and Theories have never been proven to be the Truth,
    so it is not a Fact,
    nor can it explain them,
    because if it did,
    it would be a Theory and not a Fact.

    Logic is a way of Reasoning out things that may not otherwise seem obvious,
    and Trinary Logic is a way of stating 3 State Logic Changes,
    in a way that always makes sense,
    either an Atom is Solid, Semisolid or Invisible,
    and since Atoms are Physical,
    they can be seen under an Electron Microscope,
    so there is no guessing,
    it is repeatable,
    and it is measurable,
    as well as quantifiable,
    and therefore a Fact.

    This Trinary Logic self-proves itself as you go along,
    so you can always check the Trinary Logic,
    or Trinary Math,
    since all Trinary Math,
    is based on 3 State Logic Changes,
    that cause Gravity,
    so what causes Gravity,
    and change in Frequency,
    do to an objects Wavelength,
    let me give you a good example.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    If I shipped a bowling ball to a Space Lab,
    in orbit around the Earth,
    and asked them to drop the ball to Earth,
    I can use the Balls Wavelength,
    to express its travel towards Earth,
    let us say the Lab is 66 Miles from Earths Surface,
    therefore it has a Wavelength of 66 Miles,
    and the closer the ball gets to Earth,
    the closer that Wavelength gets to 0,
    when it collides with Earth.

    When any objects Wavelength is at 0,
    it represents the Maximum Energy in any object at that time,
    this is called the Conservation of Energy.

    Energy is determined by the Force Produced during the Work the Energy does,
    for example, Energy is equal to the Wavelength when it is at its Maximum Energy Level,
    minus that same amount, minus its current Wavelength value,
    so we can track an object&#39;s Energy using its Wavelength.

    We can use Differential Equations,
    which is a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives,
    the functions usually represent physical quantities,
    the derivatives represent their rates of change,
    and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two.

    This means we can use Newtons Math,
    to determine the speed of an object as it travels the distance from 66 Miles,
    down to Earth,
    and we might determine that its Energy is pretty much the same,
    as if we only dropped it from say 90 Feet,
    where the Ball will reach its Maximum Velocity,
    and its rate of change becomes constant,
    and the rate of change in Light is a Constant,
    since it actually has none,
    so it is 0,
    since Light does not Accelerate,
    yet if I ask them to turn on a flashlight at the same they dropped the Ball,
    I could measure how long the Light took to get to me,
    at 670,616,629 mph, to confirm it was indeed 66 Miles away,
    but I could not measure the differential in Light Acceleration,
    over that distance,
    but it is clear that it is related to Frequency,
    and Wavelength,
    1 Hz = 983,571,056 Feet
    1 Foot Wavelength = 983.571056 MHz,
    so it is clear to me that Distance and Frequency are related,
    and why Trinary Math works so well,
    and why Newtons Math works so well,
    since it is based off of Light Math as well,
    and all of Tesla&#39;s Math is Light-based Math.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    The Sun is the Life Force of the Galaxy,
    only a few of them support Human Life,
    and they are all on the same Track,
    and they can be easily calculated to determine if Life can exist on them,
    based on their Frequency,
    so Trinary Math is a very useful tool for this reason alone.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    Newton wrote about the End of Time,
    that date was 14 January 2012,
    and was the End of the Time of Pisces,
    it did not end on the 1 January as most people believed it did,
    Newton was very clear about the dates,
    and 2103 came from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> of the Suns Diameter,
    2061 is minus 42 years, the year he calculated based on the Bibles record of the End of Time,
    or more commonly known as the End of Civilization as we know it.

        <img src="images/sun_20120114_183266_4096_0193.png" alt="The Sun on 14 January 2012" style="width: 99%;" /><br />

<p class="text_small">
    When you look at the Sun,
    you can see huge Electromagnetic Waves,
    making it clear that the Sun is not a Match Head,
    like Mainstream Science would want you to believe,
    it is, in fact, an Electromagnetic Generator,
    the same as our Planet,
    which provides us our Magnetosphere.

    If I look very closely at this image of the Sun,
    I can make out the letters J with a subscript of F,
    the J doubles as an I and you can just make out the C,
    as in IC, I see this a lot in the Sun,
    those are the Letters that were removed from my last name,
    so maybe it is just my Imagination,
    but the Sun seems to be talking to me.

    The Rotational Speed of any Celestial Body,
    is do to its Frequency,
    for example, the Earth has a Rotational Frequency of 12 Microhert,
    which is very slow,
    and also an Orbital Speed of 6.666 Hz,
    and since it orbits the Sun,
    it also has a 66.666 Hz forward momentum frequency,
    and since it orbits the Galaxy,
    it has a 666.666 Hz frequency,
    so all of these 3 different Energy Bands,
    make up the overall Frequency of any Celestial Body.

    If we want to find when the Sun cause our Planet to reverse its Poles,
    we only need to take <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub><sup>th</sup> of the Suns Diameter,
    to get the Maximum number of years of 2103,
    and that will actually happen in the year 2103,
    and if we minus 42 from that number,
    we get Sir Isaac Newtons 2060 End of Time Calculation from the Bible,
    in the Julian year, 2061 in the Gregorian year,
    proving Trinary Math can be used to calculate all Celestial Bodies,
    and all because it follows the same Laws, and Rules,
    as Atoms, so the Math also applies.

    Keep in mind that 42 is Hex for 66 in Decimal,
    and this date is a Curse,
    so it was only normal to use a Hex as a Curse,
    as such, 66 is the Suns Frequency,
    and 666 is the Galaxy Track Frequency for our Solar System.

    Trinary Math is used to describe all Math related to the Trinary Universe,
    and it is all based on 3 State Logic Changes in Light.
</p>

<p class="text_indent">
    After you understand the Trinary Math behind the Sun,
    and how it is the key to how the Earths Magnetosphere Reverses Polarity,
    it will become clear,
    that the Sun is just a Trinary Engine,
    and it can be calculated,
    so we can determine where we are in the Cycle,
    of traveling around the Galaxy,
    we can determine that with a Frequency of 30,000,030 Hz,
    our Solar System will cross the Galactic Plane,
    every 30 Million years,
    so we will do that 7.533 times each time we orbit the Galaxy,
    as such, everything should add up.
